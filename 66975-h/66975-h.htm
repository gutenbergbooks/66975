<h1>THE SECRET OF TONI</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2></div>

<p>Toni&rsquo;s name was Antoine Marcel, but he was
never called by it but once in his life, and that was
at his baptism, when he was eight days old.</p>

<p>He had a shock of black hair and a snub nose,
and the tan and freckles on his face were an inch
thick, but he had a pair of black eyes so soft and
bright and appealing that they might have belonged
to one of the houris of Paradise. His
wide mouth was full of sharp, white teeth, and when
he smiled, which was very often, his smile began
with his black eyes and ended with his white teeth.</p>

<p>At ten years of age Toni was a complete man of
the world&mdash;of his world, that is. This consisted of
a gay, sunny little old garrison town, Bienville by
name, in the south of France.</p>

<p>He had his friends, his foes, his lady-love, and
also he had arranged his plan of life. He knew
himself to be the most fortunate person in all Bie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>nville.
In the first place, his mother, Madame Marcel,
kept the only candy shop in the town, and Toni,
being the only child of his mother, and she a widow,
enjoyed all the advantages of this envied position.
He had no father such as other boys had&mdash;Paul
Verney, for example, the advocate&rsquo;s son&mdash;to make
him go to school when he would rather lie on his
stomach in the meadow down by the river, and
watch the butterflies dancing in the sun and the
foolish bumblebees stumbling like drunkards among
the clover blossoms.</p>

<p>Paul Verney was his best friend,&mdash;that is, except
Jacques. Toni, owing to his exceptional position,
as the only son of the house of Marcel, candy manufacturer,
would have had no lack of friends among
boys of his own age, but he was afraid of other
boys, except Paul Verney. This was pure cowardice
on Toni&rsquo;s part, because, although short for
his age, he was well built and had as good legs and
arms and was as well able to take care of himself as
any boy in Bienville. Paul Verney was a pink-cheeked,
clean, well set up boy two years older than
Toni, and as industrious as Toni was idle, as anxious
to learn as Toni was determined not to learn,
as honest with his father, the lawyer, as Toni was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>unscrupulous with his mother about the amount of
candy he consumed, and as full of quiet courage
with other boys as Toni was an arrant and shameless
poltroon about some things. Toni was classed
as a bad boy and Paul Verney as a good boy, yet
the two formed one of those strange kinships of the
soul which are stronger than blood ties and last as
long as life itself.</p>

<p>Toni, being of a shrewd and discerning mind,
realized that Paul Verney would have loved him
just as much if Madame Marcel had not kept a
candy shop, and this differentiated him from all the
other boys in Bienville, and although Paul often
severely reprobated Toni, and occasionally gave
him kicks and cuffs, which Toni could have resented
but did not, he had no fear whatever of Paul.</p>

<p>Toni&rsquo;s other friend, Jacques, was a soldier.
Jacques was about three inches high and was made
of tin. He had once been a very smart soldier, with
red trousers and an imposing shako, and a musket
as big as himself, but the paint had been worn off
the trousers and shako long ago; and as for the
musket, only the butt remained. Jacques lived in
Toni&rsquo;s pocket and he was even more intimate with
him than with Paul Verney. There were seasons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>when Paul Verney&rsquo;s kicks and cuffs caused a temporary
estrangement from him on Toni&rsquo;s part, but
there was never any estrangement between Toni and
Jacques. Jacques never remonstrated with Toni,
never contradicted him, never wanted any share of
the candy which Toni abstracted under his mother&rsquo;s
nose and ran down in the meadow to munch. There
were some things Toni could say to Jacques that he
could not say to any human being in the world, not
even to Paul Verney, and Jacques never showed the
least surprise or disgust. It is a great thing to have
a perfectly complaisant, unvarying friend always
close to one, and such was Jacques to Toni.</p>

<p>Toni had heard something about the war which
occurred a long time ago, when the soldiers went
a great way off from Bienville to a place called
Russia, where it was very cold. In Toni&rsquo;s mind,
Jacques had been to that place, and that was where
he lost the red paint off his trousers, and the black
paint off his shako, and the barrel of his musket.
Toni had a way of talking to Jacques, and imagined
that Jacques talked back to him, a notion which,
when Toni repeated what Jacques had said to him,
Paul Verney thought quite ridiculous. Jacques told
Toni long stories about that cold place called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Russia. Toni knew that there was another place,
very hot, called Algeria, and Jacques had been
there, too. Jacques had been everywhere that the
soldiers had been, and he told Toni long tales about
these places in the summer nights, when Toni was
in his little bed under the roof, with the stars peeping
in roguishly at the window, and Madame Marcel&rsquo;s
tongue and knitting needles clacking steadily
down stairs at the open door of the shop. And on
winter days, when Toni left home for school and
changed his mind and went snow-balling instead,
Jacques encouraged him by telling him that it was
very like Russia.</p>

<p>Toni also found another use for Jacques. When
he wished to say things which his mother occasionally
and properly cuffed him for, he could talk it
all out with Jacques. This seemed supremely absurd
to Paul Verney and the other boys in the
neighborhood, notably the five sons of Clery, the
tailor, who jeered at Toni when they discovered his
relations with Jacques. But Toni was as insensible
to ridicule as to reproof. The only thing that really
moved him was when his mother had rheumatism
and her knees swelled. Then Toni would cry as
if his heart would break, the big tears running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>down his dirty face as he sobbed and buried his
fists in his hair, and would not be comforted, even
though his mother could sit in her chair by the
stove, and stir the candy kettle, and would give him
the kettle to lick, after she had poured the candy
out. But this was never more than once or twice a
year, and the rest of the time Toni was as happy
and as free from care as the birdlings in spring that
sang under the linden trees in the park.</p>

<p>Toni had already arranged a marriage of convenience
for himself, which was of the most advantageous
description. Across the street from
Madame Marcel&rsquo;s shop was the baking establishment
of Mademoiselle Duval, and Denise, the niece
and idol of Mademoiselle Duval, was just two years
younger than Toni and as pretty as a pink and
white bonbon&mdash;in fact, she looked not unlike a bonbon.
She had very pink cheeks, and very blue
eyes, and a long plait of yellow hair, like the yellow
candy of <i>m&eacute;lasse</i> which Madame Marcel made
every Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Denise was as correct as Toni was incorrect. She
always said, &ldquo;<i>Oui, Monsieur</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>Non, Madame</i>,&rdquo;
in the sweetest little voice imaginable, with her eyes
cast down and her plump hands crossed before her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Not a hair of her blond head was ever out of place,
and the blue-checked apron which extended from
her neck to her heels was as speckless as the white
muslin frock she wore in church on Sundays. She
was the most obedient of children, and Madame
Marcel, when she wept and scolded Toni for his numerous
misdeeds, often told him that she wished he
were only half as good as Denise Duval, who had
never disobeyed her aunt in her life. Toni smiled
mysteriously whenever his mother said this, and
chuckled inwardly at something known only to
Jacques and himself, namely, that when he grew to
be a man he meant to marry Denise. What could
be better than the combination of a candy shop and
a cook shop and bakery?</p>

<p>And then there were other advantages connected
with the match. Many of the little girls that Toni
knew had large and dangerous-looking fathers,
some of them soldiers with fierce mustaches, and
these fathers sometimes kicked and cuffed idle little
boys who should have been at school or at home instead
of lying in the meadow or loitering upon the
bench under the acacia tree by Mademoiselle Duval&rsquo;s
shop, inhaling the delicious odors of the bakery
kitchen. Denise had a father who was, indeed, large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>and dangerous-looking and was a soldier, too; nay,
a sergeant, and had the fiercest mustache Toni had
ever seen, but he only came to Bienville once a year
for a few days on his annual leave, and seemed to
Toni a most irrational and singular person. For
although he could, if he wished, have eaten all the
cakes in his sister&rsquo;s shop, Toni never saw him so
much as look at one of them.</p>

<p>On this annual reappearance of Sergeant Duval,
Toni kept carefully out of the way. Once when he
was hiding under the counter of the shop he had
overheard the sergeant asking Madame Marcel why
she did not make that little rascal of hers go to
school, and when Madame Marcel, a pretty, plump
widow of forty, tearfully admitted that she could
not, of herself, manage Toni, the sergeant promptly
offered to give Toni a good thrashing as a favor
to Madame Marcel. This, Madame Marcel, in a
panic, declined, and then the sergeant made a proposition
still more shocking to Toni&rsquo;s feelings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why, Madame,&rdquo; he said gallantly, twirling
his mustache, &ldquo;do you not marry again? If I
were young and handsome enough I should offer
myself, and then, I warrant you, I would make that
young rogue of yours behave himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether this were an offer or not, Madame Marcel
could not determine. She might have fancied
the dashing, fierce-looking sergeant, with his five
medals on his breast, but that proposition to thrash
Toni robbed the proposal of all its charm. And besides
that, Madame Marcel, although she praised
Denise, felt a secret jealousy of the little girl&rsquo;s perfections.
Toni, as a rule, was less afraid of soldiers
than any other people, especially if they were
cavalrymen, for Toni dearly loved horses and was
not the least cowardly about them, and felt a secret
bond of sympathy between himself and all who had
to do with the cult of the horse.</p>

<p>Bienville had been a place of considerable military
consequence, in the old, far-off days, and still
retained evidences of having had ten thousand
troops quartered there in long rows of tumble-down
barrack buildings. But not much remained of this
former consequence except the old barracks, a hideous
war monument in the public square, and a very
grim old woman, the widow of a soldier in the
Napoleonic Wars. Toni regarded the monument
and old Marie, in her mob cap and spectacles, sitting
proud and stern on a bench in the public
square, as belonging to each other. All the soldiers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>and even the officers, saluted old Marie as they
passed&mdash;tributes which were received with proud
composure.</p>

<p>Everything else in the town of Bienville was gay
and cheerful, except the monument and old Marie.
It was now garrisoned by one cavalry regiment
only, and was a depot for horses and cavalry recruits.
There was a big riding-school with a tan-bark
floor, where the new recruits were broken in
and taught to ride. It was Toni&rsquo;s delight to crawl
in by the window or the small side door, and, hiding
under a pile of horse furniture in a corner,
watch the horses gallop around, their hoofs beating
softly on the tan-bark, their eyes bright and
glistening, their crests up, and their coats shining
like satin with much currying at the hands of
brawny troopers.</p>

<p>Toni did not know what it was to be afraid of a
horse, and loved nothing better than to hang about
the barracks stables and riding-school and take
cheerfully the cuffs and kicks he got from the soldiers
for being in the way. Especially was this
true on Sundays when he did not have Paul Verney&rsquo;s
company, for Paul went to church obediently,
while Toni, after submitting to be washed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>dressed clean, was almost certain to run away, disregarding
his mother&rsquo;s frantic cries after him, and
spend the whole morning in the delightful precincts
of the barracks stables. Jacques liked it, too, and
told Toni it reminded him of those glorious old
days when his trousers and shako were new and he
carried his musket jauntily, in the long red line
that set out for Russia. So Toni haunted the barracks
stables to please Jacques as well as himself.</p>

<p>One glorious and never-to-be-forgotten day, a
good-natured trooper had hoisted Toni on the back
of a steady-going old charger, who knew as much
about teaching recruits to ride as any soldier in the
regiment. The old charger, being offended at finding
the small, wriggling object upon his back, took
it into his head, for the first time since his colthood,
to plunge and kick violently, and ended by bolting
out of the barracks yard and making straight across
the edge of the town, through the meadow to the
old stone bridge that spanned the river. The
trooper, who had meant to oblige Toni, suddenly
realized that the boy was the only son of his mother
and she a widow. Jumping on another horse, he
galloped after Toni, down the stony street, into the
green lane and across the bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>The old charger, who was eighteen years old,
gave out at the end of the bridge and came down
to a sober trot. He had not, with all his efforts, got
rid of the small, wriggling object on his back. As
for Toni, he had the time of his life. It was the one
full draft of riotous joy that he had tasted. It was
better even than licking the candy kettle on Saturday
mornings. The wild flight through the air, as
it seemed to Toni, the snorting breath of the old
charger, the delicious sense of bumping up and
down, lifted him into an ecstasy. When the trooper
came up the horse was sedately browsing by the
wayside, and Toni, with his arms clasped around
the horse&rsquo;s neck and his black head down on his
mane, was in a little Heaven of his own. The
trooper, who had expected to find Toni lying by
the roadside, mangled, was immensely relieved and
swore at him out of pure joy, and, as a reward for
not having got his neck broken, allowed Toni to
ride the old charger back into the town. This was
not to be compared with that wild flight through
space, that glorious bumping up and down, that
sense of delight in feeling the horse panting under
him; but it was something.</p>

<p>Toni, trotting soberly home, concluded that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>would not tell his mother, but he meant to tell
Jacques all about it, and, putting his hand in his
pocket, Jacques was not there! Oh, what agony
was Toni&rsquo;s then! He burst into a fit of weeping,
and, rushing back to the riding-school, crawled
around frantically everywhere the troopers would
let him go, searching for his loved and lost Jacques.
The story of his ride had got out by that time and
he was not kicked and cuffed when he searched, with
streaming eyes and loud sobs, for his dearly loved
Jacques. But Jacques could not be found, not even
along the stone street, nor by the lanes, nor across
the old stone bridge, and the day grew dark to
Toni. He searched all day, and when he went home
at night and told his mother of his loss, Madame
Marcel wept, too. It was no good to promise him
a whole company of tin soldiers. They were only
tin soldiers, but Jacques was his friend, his confidant,
his other self, his oversoul. Toni cried
himself to sleep that night. It was so lonely up in
the little garret without Jacques! And Toni knew
that Jacques was lonely without him. Toni pictured
poor Jacques, alone and forlorn, lost in the
tan-bark, or trampled under foot in the street, or
floating down the darkling river, or perhaps being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>chewed up by the goats that browsed on the other
side of the bridge. In the middle of the night Madame
Marcel was awakened by Toni&rsquo;s groans and
cries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mama, mama!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how lonely
Jacques must be! What is he thinking of now? He
has no musket to take care of himself. Oh, mama!&rdquo;&mdash;and
then Toni howled again.</p>

<p>The next day Toni was up at dawn searching for
his beloved. He searched all the morning, but he
could not find the lost one. When he came home to
dinner at twelve o&rsquo;clock, he met Paul Verney, and
Paul saw by Toni&rsquo;s woebegone look and tear-stained
face that some calamity had befallen him.
Toni had looked forward with triumphant pleasure
to telling Paul about that wild ride on the old
horse&rsquo;s back, but he could give it no thought. Paul
was kind and sympathetic and understood Toni&rsquo;s
sorrow, which was of some little comfort to the bereaved
one. While the two boys sat together on
the bench under the acacia tree, close to Madame
Marcel&rsquo;s shop, up came little Denise, as neat and
pink and white as ever. One of her hands was
closed, and, as she approached Toni, she said, in
the sweetest small voice in the world:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni, is this yours? I found it in the street,&rdquo;&mdash;and,
opening her little hand&mdash;oh, joy!&mdash;there
was Jacques, his shako a little crooked, one of his
legs out of plumb, but it was Jacques. Toni, without
a word of thanks, seized Jacques, and, rushing
off, flew to his favorite spot for meditation&mdash;a little
corner on one of the abutments of the old stone
bridge. Once there, he kissed Jacques and held
him to his breast, and told him of the heart-breaking
search made for him, and Jacques, as usual,
was silently sympathetic and understood all that
Toni had suffered.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Paul Verney, ashamed for Toni&rsquo;s
want of manners in not thanking Denise and all
unaware of the great wave of gratitude that was
surging through Toni&rsquo;s whole being, went into the
shop and told Madame Marcel of Toni&rsquo;s good fortune.
Madame Marcel was so overjoyed that she
not only invited Paul to help himself to whatever
he wanted in the way of sweets, but ran out and,
catching Denise in her arms, kissed her and brought
her into the shop and invited her, as she had invited
Paul Verney, to select what she wished. Denise,
with characteristic modesty, took two small
sticks of candy, but Madame Marcel gave her, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>well as Paul, a large bag of very beautiful bonbons.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon before Toni appeared,
his eyes shining like the stars that peeped in
at his little window, his wide mouth showing all his
white teeth. Madame Marcel took him by the hand,
and they went over with state and ceremony to
thank Denise for restoring the loved and lost
Jacques. Toni felt indignant that Mademoiselle
Duval, a tall, thin, elderly, heartless, maiden lady,
should laugh at Jacques when Toni displayed him,
and tell Madame Marcel she could have bought a
couple of boxes of tin soldiers for one-half the bonbons
she had given Denise. But Toni had known
all the time that very few grown people know anything
about boys, and was simply filled with contempt
for Mademoiselle Duval. She was thin
and ugly, too, not round and plump like his own
mother, and had the bad taste to prefer clean, well-mannered
little girls to dirty and greedy boys. Up
to that time, Toni&rsquo;s feelings toward Denise had
been purely of a mercenary character, but from the
day she restored Jacques a little seedling sentiment
sprang up in Toni&rsquo;s heart; the great master of all
passions had planted it there. It was something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>like what he felt for Paul Verney&mdash;a sense of well-being,
even of protection, when Denise was near.
She had acted the part of a guardian angel, she had
restored Jacques to him, and she did not seem to
mind his dirty face and grimy hands. She acquired
a bewitching habit of dividing with Toni the stale
apple tarts her aunt gave her, and, beckoning to
him across the street, she would have him sit by her
on the bench under the acacia tree and always give
him at least two-thirds of the tarts.</p>

<p>A few days after the tragedy of Jacques&rsquo; loss
and return, Sergeant Duval, Denise&rsquo;s father, appeared
for his annual visit to Bienville. The story
of Jacques was told to him, and when he came over
to pay his call of ceremony on Madame Marcel,
he was so rude as to twit Toni about Jacques.
Toni, much displeased at this, retired to his usual
place of refuge under the counter, and concluded
that when he married Denise he would contrive to
be absent during Sergeant Duval&rsquo;s annual visit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2></div>

<p>Paul Verney was twelve years old, and had never
had any affairs of the heart, like Toni. But one
June afternoon, in the same summer when Toni had
lost and recovered Jacques, and had succumbed to
the tender passion, fate overtook Paul Verney in
the person of Lucie Bernard, the prettiest little
creature imaginable, prettier even than Denise and
very unlike that small piece of perfection. Paul,
who was very fond of reading, took his book, which
happened to be an English one, to the park that
afternoon of fate, and was sitting on a bench,
laboriously puzzling over the English language,
when a beautiful little girl in blue, with a gigantic
sash and large pale blue hat, with roses blushing all
over it, under which her dark hair fell to her waist,
came composedly up to him and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me see your book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul was so astonished at being addressed by a
young lady, under the circumstances, that he
promptly handed over his book, and Lucie, seating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>herself on the bench, proceeded to read it. Paul
was surprised to see that the English book, through
which he had been painfully spelling his way,
seemed perfectly easy to Lucie, who, without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, read on, remarking casually to
Paul:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can read English as well as I can read French.
My mother was an American, you know, and Americans
speak English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul did not know the piece of family history
thus confided to him, nor, indeed, did he know anything
about this little nymph, but he thought in his
honest little heart that she was the most charming
vision his boyish eyes had ever rested on. He admired
her dainty little slippers, her silk stockings,
her general air of fashion, but blushed at finding
himself sitting on the same bench with her, particularly
as he saw his father the gray-haired advocate,
Monsieur Paul Verney, approaching. He was just
about to sneak away, leaving his book in the hands
of the fair brigand, when a fierce-looking English
nursery governess suddenly descended upon them,
and, seizing Lucie by the arm, carried her off. The
governess threw Paul&rsquo;s book down on the gravel
path, and Paul picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Somehow, the book seemed to have a different
aspect after having been held in the charming little
fairy&rsquo;s hands. Paul was possessed by a wholly new
set of emotions. He longed to tell some one of this
startling adventure&mdash;a little girl planting herself
on the bench by him and taking his book from him
without the least embarrassment or even apology.
What very strange little girls must those be whose
mothers were American! Paul had plenty of
friends among the boys of his own age and class,
and among his school-mates, but he had never confided
in any of them as he did in Toni Marcel. So
presently, wandering down by the bridge where he
was certain to find Toni at this hour of the day, he
saw his friend perched in the little cranny which he
called his own, on the bridge above the dark and
rippling water. Two small boys could be squeezed
into this place and Paul Verney, climbing up, sat
side by side with Toni, and, with his arm around
his friend&rsquo;s neck, bashfully but delightedly told
Toni and Jacques, who, of course, heard everything
that was told to Toni, all about this beautiful
dream-like creature he had seen in the park. Then
Toni said, without any bashfulness at all:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have got a sweetheart, too&mdash;it is Denise;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>some day I am going to marry her, and in the morning
we will eat candy at mama&rsquo;s shop, and in the
afternoon we will eat cakes at Mademoiselle Duval&rsquo;s
shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni&rsquo;s eyes, as he said this, shone with a dark
and lambent light. Paul Verney, on the contrary,
had a pair of ordinary light blue eyes through
which his honest, tender soul glowed. He was the
most romantic boy alive, but all his romantic notions
he had carefully concealed from every human
being until then. A dream had come into his boyish
mind, not of munching bonbons and stuffing cakes,
such as Toni&rsquo;s practical mind had conceived, but a
dream of the beautiful Lucie grown up, dressed in
a lovely white satin gown, with a tulle veil and
orange blossoms, such as he had once seen a young
lady wear when she was married to a dashing lieutenant
in a dazzling uniform. Paul meant to be a
dashing lieutenant in a dazzling uniform some day,
and then the vision of Lucie, stealing instantly into
his mind, seemed to fill a place already prepared
for her there. The two lads sat, Paul&rsquo;s closely-cropped,
reddish hair resting upon Toni&rsquo;s disheveled
black shock, and felt very near together
indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But how will you ever see mademoiselle again?&rdquo;
said Toni to Paul.</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s face grew sad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I ever shall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
never had a girl speak to me before, and I never
played with a girl&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s proper. And
the English governess was so cross to Lucie&mdash;for
so she called her. But I shall walk every day in
the park, and perhaps I shall see her again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul was as good as his word and the very next
afternoon walked in the park by himself. He was
a neat boy always, but that day his face shone with
scrubbing, and he had on his best sailor suit of
white linen, and his little cane in his hand. It was
about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and even the
shady paths of the park glowed with a beautiful,
mysterious, green light. As Paul walked along, he
heard a whisper in his ear. It was Toni, who had
crept up from behind a clump of shrubbery and
said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There she is, just down that path, sitting with
Captain and Madame Ravenel and holding Madame
Ravenel&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul, following the path, came at once on the
bench where sat his divinity, as Toni had described.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>He doubted if he would have had the courage to
bow to her, but Lucie called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is the nice little boy who was reading
the English book yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul, blushing up to the roots of his reddish hair,
made three bows, one to Madame Ravenel, one to
Lucie, and one to Captain Ravenel. Madame Ravenel
returned his bow, as did the captain, with
much gravity, and Paul passed on, his heart beating
with rapture. He had quite often seen the
Ravenels and knew them by name. They were apparently
the only sad-looking persons in all
Bienville. They lived in a small, high, gloomy, old
house with a garden at the back, just around the
corner from the little street in which Madame Marcel
had her shop. Captain Ravenel was a retired
officer, but no one ever saw him talking with any of
the officers of the garrison, nor was he ever known
either to enter any of their houses or to welcome
any officers to his house.</p>

<p>Madame Ravenel was the most beautiful woman
in Bienville. She was about thirty, but so sad-looking
that she seemed much older. She always wore
black&mdash;not widow&rsquo;s black or mourning, but black
gowns which, although very simple, had an air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>elegance that set off her rare beauty wonderfully.
Paul had seen her nearly every day since the Ravenels
first came to Bienville three years before, but
he did not remember ever having seen Lucie until
that glorious hour when she burst on his dazzled
vision and took his book away from him. From the
time he could first remember seeing Madame Ravenel
he had never passed her without a feeling coming
into his boyish soul like that when he saw the
moon looking down on the dark water under the
bridge, or heard the melancholy song of the nightingale
in the evening. He had confided this feeling
to Toni, who answered that both he and Jacques
felt the same way when they saw Madame Ravenel.
There was something sad, beautiful, touching and
interesting about her. Paul could not put it into
words, but he felt it, as did many other people.</p>

<p>Madame Ravenel went to church every morning,
and when Paul was dressing himself in his little
bedroom, off from his father&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s room,
he could always see her returning from church.
And what was most remarkable to Paul, Captain
Ravenel was always either with Madame Ravenel or
not far behind her. He did not go into the church,
but, with a book or a newspaper in his hand, walked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>up and down outside until Madame Ravenel appeared,
when he would escort her home. And so it
was almost always the case, when Madame Ravenel
appeared on the street that Captain Ravenel was
not far away. It would seem as if he kept within
protecting distance. He was a soldierly-appearing
man, serious-looking, his hair and mustache slightly
gray.</p>

<p>Madame Ravenel was always beautiful, always
sad, always gentle, and always in black. Paul had
noticed, in passing the church sometimes, that Madame
Ravenel never went beyond the entrance and
never sat down, even on Sundays. She only went
a few steps inside the church door, and Paul asked
his mother why this was. Madame Verney shut
him up shortly with that well-known maxim that
little boys should not ask questions. Sometime
after that, Paul, still wondering about Madame
Ravenel, asked his father why she looked so sad,
and why Captain Ravenel never stopped and
laughed and talked with the officers walking the
streets, or dining at the caf&eacute;s, or strolling in the
park, and Monsieur Verney gave him the same reply
as Madame Verney, which was most discouraging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>This, of course, did not cause Paul&rsquo;s interest in
the Ravenels to abate in the least. It only convinced
him that they had some strange and interesting
story, such as having found a pot of gold
somewhere, or having had their only child stolen
from them, or some of those delightfully romantic
tales which a twelve-year-old boy can imagine. He
was no less interested in Lucie on finding that she
belonged in some way to Madame Ravenel. He
had walked on a considerable distance in the park,
and was trying to screw up his courage to turn
around and walk back past the bench where Lucie
sat, when he suddenly found her at his side. Her
dark eyes glowed brightly and she was tiptoeing
in her delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know all about you,&rdquo; she said triumphantly.
&ldquo;You are Paul Verney, the advocate&rsquo;s son. I like
little boys very much&mdash;very much&mdash;but I never
have a chance to see anything of them. However,
just now I began to chase a butterfly and my sister
Sophie did not call me back. But you are the butterfly,&rdquo;&mdash;and
at this she burst into a ripple of
impish laughter.</p>

<p>Paul was so surprised that he did not have time
to be shocked at the boldness on the part of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>young lady of ten years, but his heart began to
thump violently and he was trembling when he said
to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But aren&rsquo;t you afraid to leave your sister?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; replied Lucie airily. &ldquo;I am
half American, and American children are not
afraid of anything, so Harper, my nursery governess,
says. What can happen to me? And besides
that, I have always had my own way&mdash;that is,
almost always&mdash;I had it about coming to see my
sister Sophie. Would you like me to tell you
about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul was only too charmed to hear anything
Lucie might tell him, although in a panic for fear
the fierce-looking English nursery governess might
appear. Lucie, without further ado, seated herself
with him on the ground and, sticking her little slippered
feet out on the grass, began, with the air of
Scheherazade, when with confidence she turned her
matchless power on the bridegroom who meant to
murder her next morning:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophie, you know, is my sister, although she is
much older than I am. We had the same papa, but
not the same mama, but Sophie was just like a
mama to me after my own mama died. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>married then to another man named Count Delorme.
How I hated him! He was so cross&mdash;cross to me
and cross to Sophie and cross to everybody. He
had a son, too, when Sophie married him, and that
boy&mdash;Edouard was his name&mdash;was horrid, just like
Count Delorme. I lived with Sophie then, and once
a year I would go and visit my Grandmother Bernard.
She is very tall and handsome and always
wears black velvet or black satin and looks very
fierce. Everybody is afraid of her except me. But
she isn&rsquo;t really in the least fierce, and I have my
own way with her much more than I have with
Sophie. All that grandmama can do is to scold
and say, &lsquo;Oh, you little American, what am I to do
with you? You need more strictness than any
French child I ever knew,&rsquo; and then she lets me do
as I please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucie stopped here and cast a side glance at
Paul. She possessed the art of the story-teller and
wanted to know whether Paul was interested in what
she was telling him. Paul was so much interested
in Lucie that he would have listened with pleasure
to anything she said, but the beginning of what she
was telling him sounded like a book, and he listened
with eagerness. Lucie, seeing this, proceeded.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>Like many other people, she enjoyed being the
heroine of her own tale, and it lost nothing in the
telling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I used to like this visit to my grandmother&mdash;she
has a big ch&acirc;teau, larger than the commandant&rsquo;s
house, five times as large&mdash;bigger than the
Hotel de Ville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucie opened her arms and hands wide to show
Paul the enormous size of the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then she has such beautiful things&mdash;so
many servants, carriages, horses, chandeliers, and
gardens&mdash;the most beautiful gardens, and a park
ten times as large as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul listened to this somewhat coldly. He did
not like bragging and could not understand the
innocent, imaginative delight which Lucie took in
describing a pretty ch&acirc;teau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I used to love to go there and visit grandmama
when I lived with Sophie. We lived in another
place&mdash;a great big city called Ch&acirc;lons. But I
loved being with Sophie best. She was not at all
like what she is now, but she was the gayest person
in Ch&acirc;lons. She wore beautiful pink gowns, and
white hats, and feathers, and went to balls every
night, but she always had time to look after me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>She used to take me in the carriage with her every
afternoon to drive, and before she went to a ball she
always saw me undressed and in my bed and came to
tell me good night. And she looked over my lessons
and made me practise my music and did everything
for me, just as the other little girls&rsquo; mamas
did for them. Then something happened&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
know what it was&mdash;it was something dreadful,
though, and I remember the day. It rained very
hard, and Captain Ravenel came in the afternoon
and was sitting in the drawing-room with Sophie,
and Count Delorme came in, and there was a terrible
noise, and the door came open, and Count Delorme
struck Sophie with his fist hard, and Captain
Ravenel caught her in his arms. I was leaning over
the baluster, and then Harper ran down, and carried
me off, and would not let me go near Sophie,
though I heard her crying outside the door, and I
cried inside the door just as hard as I could. The
next day Harper&mdash;that is my nursery governess
that takes care of me now and dragged me away
yesterday&mdash;came and took me in a carriage to the
railway station, without letting me say good-by
to Sophie, and carried me off to my grandmama&rsquo;s
ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul was interested enough now. Lucie&rsquo;s story
sounded more and more like a story out of a book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I came to the ch&acirc;teau, my grandmother&mdash;she
is Sophie&rsquo;s grandmama just as much as she
is mine&mdash;kissed me, and hugged me, and told me
I was to live there, but I was very angry because
I hadn&rsquo;t seen Sophie to say good-by even, and I
kept asking why Sophie didn&rsquo;t come to see me or
send for me or even write me a letter. I used to
write her letters myself&mdash;you see, I am ten years
old and I can write very well&mdash;and I gave them
to grandmama to send to Sophie, but I found a
whole bunch of my letters half-burned in the grate
in grandmama&rsquo;s room. Then I saw they were deceiving
me, so I wrote a letter and I stole a postage
stamp, and I knew how to address it to Sophie, but
I got no reply. Then I stole some more postage
stamps, and wrote some more letters, but I never
heard anything about Sophie. I had a governess
and music-master, but grandmama never made me
study or practise my music as Sophie had done.
She let me do everything I wanted except to see
or hear from Sophie. No matter what I asked for,
grandmama first refused and then she got it for
me. She bought me the finest doll in Paris and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>a little pony and wicker phaeton, and used to take
me to the circus&mdash;my grandmama lives near Paris,
you know&mdash;and gave me five francs of my own to
spend every Saturday. But I wanted Sophie. At
night I would think about her, and cry and cry,
and then grandmama would have me put in her bed
and she would cry, too, but she would not let me see
Sophie. At last I couldn&rsquo;t eat anything&mdash;not even
bonbons&mdash;and they sent for the doctor, who said
grandmama must take me to the sea-shore, but
after we came from the sea-shore I missed Sophie
more and more, and I cried every night and would
not eat, and at last I told grandmama if she did
not let me see Sophie I would starve myself to death&mdash;I
would never eat anything&mdash;I would hold my
breath until I died&mdash;or eat a cake of paint out of
my paint-box. Paint is poisonous, you know.
Grandmama told me of a little girl who died from
eating paint out of her paint-box. At last even the
doctor grew frightened, and told grandmama if I
did not see my sister Sophie he was afraid I would
be very ill, so then&mdash;this was two summers ago&mdash;she
let Harper bring me here, and I stayed a whole
week with Sophie. Captain Ravenel is her husband
now, and not that hateful Count Delorme, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>didn&rsquo;t know Captain Ravenel before, but I love him
now almost as much as I do Sophie. He is so kind
and good, and not a bit cross. Sophie told me that
I must be satisfied with my week with her, and must
be good, and perhaps grandmama would let me
come again, and that when I went back to the
Ch&acirc;teau Bernard I must eat and keep well and not
cry any more. I did as Sophie told me, but Sophie
doesn&rsquo;t know grandmama as well as I do. I begged
her all last winter to let me come and see Sophie
again, and all this spring, and then this summer,
but she wouldn&rsquo;t let me, and then I found out how
to manage grandmama.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul listened to this with an interest which bordered,
however, on disapproval. He had never
heard of small children managing their elders, but
Lucie had told him that she was half American,
which might account for anything. Paul had
heard that the Americans were a wild people, so
perhaps even the children did as they pleased.
Lucie drew up her little silk-stockinged foot, and
settled her skirts around her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you suppose I did it? I didn&rsquo;t eat
anything for two days. Grandmama was frightened
to death. When I wouldn&rsquo;t eat, they left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>cakes around, and beautiful little biscuit, but I
knew what that was for and wouldn&rsquo;t touch them;
so after three days grandmama gave in and told
me that Harper might bring me to see Sophie, and
so I came, and I am to stay two whole weeks, and
after this every time I wish to see Sophie, all I
will have to do is to stop eating, for that frightens
grandmama and she lets me have my own way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul eyed the bewitching Lucie still with some
disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you think it is right to treat your
grandmama so? Isn&rsquo;t she a good grandmama to
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, indeed,&rdquo; answered Lucie. &ldquo;I love
her very much, but not like Sophie. You love your
aunts and grandmama, but not like your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was quite true, for Paul was as fond, in
his quiet way, of his mother and father, as Lucie,
in her violent and demonstrative fashion was of
Sophie, or as Toni was curiously fond of Madame
Marcel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2></div>

<p>While this conversation was going on, Toni, who
had seen Lucie go chasing after the butterfly,
watched Captain and Madame Ravenel. Paul had
told him there was something mysterious about the
pair, and Toni was vaguely conscious of this
strangeness, and felt in his childish, ignorant way,
like Paul, the charm of Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s touching
beauty. He heard Madame Ravenel say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have become of the child?&rdquo; and Captain
Ravenel got up at once to look for her, going
a little way along the path down which Lucie had
disappeared. And then a strange thing happened
before Toni&rsquo;s eyes. A young officer coming by,
with a waxed mustache and his cap set jauntily on
the side of his head, stopped directly in front of
Madame Ravenel, and looked at her with a smile
which Toni did not at all understand, but which
made Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s pale face flush to the roots
of her dark hair. Then the officer said, in an insolent
yet insinuating voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;May I be permitted, Madame, to admire your
beauty a little closer?&rdquo;&mdash;and sat down on the bench
without any invitation, throwing his arm around
the back of it so as almost to embrace Madame
Ravenel, who started up with a cry. At that moment,
Captain Ravenel appeared at the back of
the bench. He was not so big a man as the young
officer, but, catching him by his collar, he threw
him sprawling on the ground, and then deliberately
stamped upon him as he lay prostrate. Madame
Ravenel stood as still as a statue. The officer
sprang from the ground and would have flown at
Captain Ravenel&rsquo;s throat, but two other officers
passing ran toward them and separated them, and
pinioned the arms of the officer to his side. Toni
heard Captain Ravenel say, as he handed his card
to one of the officers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw this man grossly insult this lady, and he
shall pay for it with his life,&rdquo;&mdash;and then Madame
Ravenel swayed a minute or two and fell over in a
dead faint. The two officers hurried their comrade
off, leaving Captain Ravenel alone with Madame
Ravenel, who lay prone on the grass, quite
insensible.</p>

<p>Toni remembered having once seen a lady faint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>in the park, and that some one fetched water
from the fountain close by, and dashed it on her
face, but he had nothing to fetch it in, having no
hat on his head&mdash;a hat being a useless incumbrance
which he only wore on those rare Sundays when
his mother dragged him to church against his
earnest protests. But there was Paul Verney&rsquo;s hat.
Toni scampered down the path and in two minutes
had found Paul. Lucie was just leaving him, and
Toni, mysteriously beckoning to him, whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fill your cap with water and take it to Madame
Ravenel. She is lying on the grass fainting like I
saw a lady once, and somebody at that time threw
water on the lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul, with the true lover&rsquo;s instinct to serve those
loved by his adored one, ran to the fountain and
filled his cap with water, and then flew as fast as
his legs would carry him to the place where Madame
Ravenel still lay. Most of the water was
spilled over his white linen suit, but there was
enough left to revive Madame Ravenel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my boy,&rdquo; said Captain Ravenel, as
he dashed the water on Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s face.
Then she opened her eyes and tried to stand up.
Paul ran for more water, and came back with about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>a tablespoonful left in his cap, while he himself was
dripping like a water spaniel. But Madame Ravenel,
by that time, was sitting up on the bench, pale,
with her dark hair disheveled, and her hat still lying
on the ground. Captain Ravenel was supporting
her.</p>

<p>Paul Verney, being a gentleman at twelve years
of age, felt instinctively that having done a service
it was his place to retire. He received a tremulous
&ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; from Madame Ravenel, who then
asked anxiously of Captain Ravenel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is Lucie&mdash;what has become of the
child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Lucie at that moment appeared, and Paul,
longing to remain and hear more interesting stories
about grown people from Lucie&rsquo;s cherry lips, still
felt bound to retire, which he did.</p>

<p>Toni, on the contrary, making no pretensions to
being a gentleman, had to see the whole thing
played through. He concealed himself behind the
shrubbery, and saw with pain, but with deep interest,
Madame Ravenel weep a little&mdash;tears which
Captain Ravenel tried to check. Then, in a moment,
Harper appeared and Lucie went off, her
usually sparkling, dimpling little face quite sor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>rowful;
and then Madame Ravenel, leaning on
Captain Ravenel&rsquo;s arm, walked away.</p>

<p>Toni stood and pondered these things to himself.
What queer creatures grown people were after all!
Still they were very interesting if one got rid of
all their scrapes and muddles. What did that
dashing-looking officer want to put his arm around
Madame Ravenel for? Toni, reflecting on these
things, took Jacques out and asked him about them,
but Jacques replied that he knew no more about
them than Toni did.</p>

<p>That night Toni, not being made to go to bed
at eight o&rsquo;clock like Paul Verney and all other
well-conducted boys, was prowling around the garden
of the commandant&rsquo;s house, of which the back
was toward the little street in which Madame Marcel
lived. The garden gate was open, and Toni
sneaked in and seated himself on the grass, just
outside the window on the ground floor which looked
into a room that was Colonel Duquesne&rsquo;s study.</p>

<p>Toni had an object in this. There was a great
clump of gooseberry bushes under this window, and
Toni loved to gorge himself on Colonel Duquesne&rsquo;s
gooseberries. True, he could have had all the
gooseberries he wished from his mother, but they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>did not have the delicious flavor of those surreptitiously
confiscated from Colonel Duquesne&rsquo;s garden.
Toni was afraid of the commandant, as he
was afraid of the monument in the public square
and of old Marie, and of everybody, in fact, except
his mother, and Paul Verney, and little Denise, and
Jacques. But he knew the garden much better
than the commandant did, and his short legs were
quick enough to save him in case any one should
come out of the house.</p>

<p>Toni saw, through the window, the two officers,
who had separated the other officer and Captain
Ravenel, sitting in grave conversation with the
colonel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is most unfortunate!&rdquo; said the colonel, a
grave-looking, gray-mustached man. &ldquo;What could
have induced Ravenel to come to Bienville to live?
It would seem to be the last place on earth that he
and Madame Ravenel would select.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then one of the other officers said to the colonel:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that they came here principally
on account of Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s health, and besides,
Ravenel owns the house in which they live.
It isn&rsquo;t much of a house, but I hear that Delorme
spent every franc of Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s money, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>they have nothing but this house and Ravenel&rsquo;s
half-pay to live on, which probably accounts for
their being in Bienville. But I must say that they
have kept themselves as much out of sight as possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew Delorme,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;and a more
unprincipled scoundrel never lived. It is a great
pity that Ravenel didn&rsquo;t knock the fellow&rsquo;s brains
out on the day when Madame Delorme left Delorme.
Nobody would have been sorry for it. I
have known both Ravenel and Madame Ravenel for
years, and they are the last people living that I
should expect to commit the folly they did, going
off together and remaining two or three weeks before
they separated. It was a species of madness,
but they have paid dearly for it. I understand that
Madame Ravenel is tormented by religious scruples
about her divorce.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel got up from his chair and walked
up and down two or three times. The vision of
Sophie Ravenel in her triumphant beauty ten years
before, and the pale conscience-stricken Sophie of
to-day, overwhelmed him. He remembered Ravenel,
spirited, gay, and caring for no other than a
soldier&rsquo;s life, and now cut off from all comrades,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>his life-work ended. Surely these two had paid the
full price for their three weeks&rsquo; desperate folly, of
love, shame, rapture and despair. Then awakening
suddenly to the madness of what they had done,
they had separated, not to see each other again
until Delorme had obtained a divorce; and Sophie,
after having been branded as a wife who had dishonored
her husband, was married to Ravenel, who,
for her sake, had sacrificed all his worldly prospects.
The colonel was a strict moralist, but in
his heart he reckoned that there were many worse
people in the world than Sophie and Ravenel. The
two officers sat silent while the colonel took a couple
of turns about the room, and then he sat down and
spoke again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the question is&mdash;what are we to do about
Creci?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Creci swears,&rdquo; said the older of the two officers,
&ldquo;that Madame Ravenel smiled at him as he passed
and gave him an invitation to come and sit by
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said the colonel, in a very cold
voice, as he shook the ash from his cigar, &ldquo;that
Creci is mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistaken!&rdquo; thought Toni to himself, &ldquo;Creci
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>was lying, pure and simple.&rdquo; That Toni knew,
for he had seen the whole transaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are bound, under the circumstances,&rdquo; said
Captain Merrilat, &ldquo;to take Lieutenant Creci&rsquo;s
word for it. Naturally Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s word
can not be taken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Duquesne pondered for a while, stroking
his mustache, and then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to me in two days&mdash;I will see what can
be done,&rdquo;&mdash;and then, after a little more talk, the
two officers got up and went away, and Colonel
Duquesne strolled out in the garden where Toni
was still behind the gooseberry bushes.</p>

<p>The colonel knew the Widow Marcel&rsquo;s boy and
disapproved of him on general principles, but did
not suspect the little scamp was hidden behind the
gooseberry bushes which the colonel passed as he
walked up and down the dark path. As he turned
to pass the third time, he heard Tom&rsquo;s shrill, boyish
voice piping out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Jacques, I saw it all&mdash;I was watching
Captain and Madame Ravenel, and I saw Captain
Ravenel when he got up and went away&mdash;and
then the young officer came along, and Madame
Ravenel wasn&rsquo;t looking his way at all&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>was looking down with her hands in her lap, and
I don&rsquo;t think she even saw the lieutenant until he
came up to her quite close and said something
impudent to her, and then Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s face
got as red as red could be, and the lieutenant
plumped himself down as close to her as he could
and threw his arm around the back of the bench,
and Madame Ravenel looked scared to death and
jumped up, and then Captain Ravenel came and
caught the lieutenant by the collar and threw him
on the ground and wiped his foot on him, and you
know, Jacques, you saw that just as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel stopped suddenly in his walk, and
looking about, saw Toni&rsquo;s little black head among
the gooseberry bushes. He did not see the other
boy with whom Toni was talking, but he understood
well enough what Toni meant. Then Toni
kept on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jacques, I tell you, Madame Ravenel wasn&rsquo;t
even looking at the lieutenant, and I know she
hates him by the way she pushed him off when he
sat down by her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel walked around the gooseberry bushes
and there sat Toni on the ground, but Jacques,
whom the colonel innocently supposed to be an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>other
boy, was not in sight, being then in Toni&rsquo;s
pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, my lad,&rdquo; said the colonel, &ldquo;you saw the
fight between Captain Ravenel and Lieutenant
Creci?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Toni, looking up at the colonel&rsquo;s short, soldierly
figure and determined air, was seized with
one of those sudden panics which often overcame
him. He could not have said a word to save his
life, with the colonel&rsquo;s keen eyes fixed on him. So,
jumping up and seizing hold of Jacques in his
pocket, Toni ran as fast as his legs would take
him to the garden gate, through the narrow street,
and up into his own little attic room, and did not
feel safe until he was tucked in his own bed with
Jacques under the pillow to keep him company.</p>

<p>It was the habit of the colonel to take a walk in
the park very early every morning directly after
his breakfast coffee, and it was also Captain Ravenel&rsquo;s
practice to pass through the park at the same
hour. His, however, was not a pleasure stroll, but
was for the purpose of taking to the post-office
some hundreds of envelopes which he addressed every
day for a pittance, with which to eke out his
half-pay. The two men had been friends in past
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>days, although the colonel was much older and
higher in rank than Ravenel, but they passed each
other morning after morning without a word being
exchanged, Ravenel gravely saluting the colonel,
and the colonel slightly returning the bow, and
each man felt a tug at his heart for the other man.</p>

<p>Colonel Duquesne was a great stickler for the
moralities, and Ravenel&rsquo;s fall had been to him a
terrible shock. He understood what little Lucie,
and Paul Verney, and Toni did not understand in
the least, the particular thing which had befallen
Madame Ravenel. It was the old, sad story of a
villainous husband to a sensitive and dependent
woman, of a man a thousand times better than the
husband loving the wife silently, of hearing her unjustly
accused in his presence, and even suffering
the indignity of a blow. That blow drove Sophie
Delorme into Ravenel&rsquo;s arms. It seemed to her, in
the horror and shock of the moment, as if there
were no other place for her. She could not go to
her grandmother, Madame Bernard, who had arranged
the match between Sophie and Delorme and
who had shut her eyes stubbornly to the wretchedness
of the marriage. Apart from Madame Bernard,
Sophie was singularly alone in the world.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Her small fortune had been squandered by Delorme.
She loved Ravenel because she could not
help it, and so these two poor souls, like goodly
ships driven against each other by storms and hurricanes,
to their destruction, this man and this
woman were driven together, driven to transgress
the moral law, driven by the iron hand of fate into
a position, the last on earth that would have been
expected of them.</p>

<p>The victory of passion and despair over honor
had been brief. In three weeks they recoiled from
what they had done. Delorme had promptly begun
proceedings for a divorce and Ravenel had besought
Sophie to repair their fault as far as possible
in the eyes of the world by marrying him as
soon as the decree of divorce should be granted.
But Sophie was a deeply religious woman and it
seemed to her an increase of wrong-doing to marry
Ravenel. There was but one way out of it and
Ravenel, by employing one of the best ecclesiastical
lawyers in France, discovered that there were
certain technicalities in the religious marriage
that Delorme had not complied with, and it was
possible to have the marriage, religious as well as
civil, annulled. Only then did Sophie consent to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>marry him. For her he had sacrificed his position
in the army, his standing in the world and his modest
fortune, and had done it as if it were a privilege
instead of a sacrifice.</p>

<p>No woman of Sophie Ravenel&rsquo;s lofty ideals could
fail to appreciate this, but neither could she forget
that she had fallen from her high estate. However
she might strive to be happy, Ravenel could
not but see that she would live and die a conscience-stricken
woman. She made no moan, however, but
secretly took on herself the whole sin. Ravenel
did the same, taking on himself all the blame.
And so their married life, although sad and colorless,
was one of exquisite harmony. They led a
most retired life, rarely leaving their house except
for Sophie&rsquo;s early visit to the church and the walk
in the park in the afternoons. Whenever she appeared
on the street, as Paul often had noticed,
Ravenel was never far away, and Sophie, had any
affront been offered her, had his protection close at
hand. To them one place was the same as another
and, as Colonel Duquesne had imagined, necessity
had much to do with their settling in Bienville.
An officer on half-pay has not much choice of residence,
and the little old house in Bienville at least
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>gave them a shelter. So they had come, bringing
their remorse with them, likewise their love.</p>

<p>The wages of sin in their case was not luxury.
They lived as poorly as gentle people could live
and exist. They kept no servant, and as it was
painful for them to have to dine at the caf&eacute;s, Sophie,
with the assistance of one old woman who was
still active at seventy-five, prepared all their meals.
With her own hands she made those cheap and simple
black gowns whose fit and style were the despair
and admiration of the professional dressmakers in
Bienville. In this matter of her dress and appearance,
Sophie retained all the pride which had ever
been hers when she was, as little Lucie said, the
gayest and best-dressed woman in Ch&acirc;lons. It was
a part of a duty that she owed Ravenel, for with
the fine generosity of a woman she reckoned herself
much in Ravenel&rsquo;s debt, and felt she should
lose as few as possible of those charms that had
won him to his downfall. She never lost her appearance
of elegance, by dint of an ingenuity, little
short of miraculous. She uttered no complaining
word, and no day passed over her head that she did
not tell Ravenel he was the best man in the world.</p>

<p>There was a wheezy old piano in the little house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>and on this she played to him the airs that had
charmed him in the days at Ch&acirc;lons. She was externally
the most modest and reserved woman in
Bienville,&mdash;and who shall say that she was not the
same in her soul? Be not too free, you virtuous
people, to condemn this poor lady; there are sinners
and sinners, if you please.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo1"><img src="images/i_050.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;Not daring so much as to lift her eyes to the altar.&rdquo;"
title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Not daring so much as to lift her eyes to the altar.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">As for Captain Ravenel, his wrong-doing had
placed on him, according to his way of thinking,
an obligation of a life most spotless. He had
always been, as Colonel Duquesne had said, a man
of high character, but when love and misery and
fate had made him, in a way, the destroyer of the
woman he loved and respected most on earth, it
raised him to a pitch of heroic virtue. Like Sophie,
no drudgery was too great for him and when she
was preparing their modest dinner, Captain Ravenel
was digging in the garden. By the labor of his
own hands, he raised the most beautiful pease, potatoes
and melons that had ever been seen. He would
have worked every hour of the day, except that he
felt as Sophie did with regard to him, that he must
not lose all of those graces and habits of a gentleman
which had first made her love him. In the
afternoon he dressed himself in his well-brushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>frock coat and together he and Sophie took a walk,
and sat and listened to the band playing in the
park. This was their chief recreation. At night
he sat up many hours addressing those envelopes
and circulars which he took to the post-office early
in the morning and for which he was paid a pittance.
Like Sophie, no complaint escaped him, and
for every protestation of love and gratitude she
made to him, he returned in twofold. They were
not happy&mdash;life had no happiness to give two souls
like theirs, situated as they were&mdash;but they would
have died if they had been torn apart.</p>

<p>It was a portion of Sophie&rsquo;s self-imposed punishment
that she should never go fully into a church,
halting, as Paul Verney had noticed, just within
the door, and, like the publican, not daring so much
as to lift her eyes to the altar, but calling herself
a sinner and feeling herself to be the greatest sinner
on earth. Another part of her punishment
was the separation from Lucie, the little half-sister
whom she had attended from the hour of her birth
with a mother&rsquo;s care, and toward whom she had
taken a mother&rsquo;s place. But she made no complaint
of this, nor of anything else; and when Lucie, by
her own ingenuity, had contrived to come back to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>her, it brought a gleam of joy into Sophie&rsquo;s life
such as she had never expected to feel again.</p>

<p>Madame Bernard remained unforgiving. As
Lucie had truly said, although as stern and uncompromising
in looks as the monument in the public
square at Bienville and old Marie who sat on the
bench and knitted sternly, Madame Bernard was,
at heart, a greater coward about people than little
Toni. She knew if she once saw Sophie everything
would be forgiven, and so she avoided seeing her,
and dared not even write to her. Little Lucie had
had no real difficulty in accomplishing her object
of seeing Sophie by the means she had retailed to
Paul, and otherwise wrapped the stately Madame
Bernard around her little finger.</p>

<p>Lucie, who was accustomed to luxury, adapted
herself with ingenuous perversity to the plain way
of living of the Ravenels. She even learned to
make omelettes herself, and with her little lace-trimmed
gown tucked up around her waist, to the
horror of Harper, the nursery governess, actually
learned to broil a chop as well as Sophie could.</p>

<p>Lucie was a child of many passions. Her attachment
to Sophie was one of the strongest, and
Sophie alone, of everybody on earth, could bend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>Lucie to her will,&mdash;that is, as long as they were together,
for, childlike, Lucie forgot all the gentle
commands and recommendations laid upon her by
Sophie when they separated, and remembered few
of the admirable things which Sophie asked her
to do. But she loved Sophie with a determined
constancy that none of Madame Bernard&rsquo;s blandishments
nor all the bonbons in Paris could
change.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2></div>

<p>At the hour when Colonel Duquesne and the two
officers were discussing Creci&rsquo;s insult to Sophie&mdash;for
insult they all well knew it to be&mdash;Sophie and
Ravenel were sitting on their balcony after their
supper, and Lucie had been put to bed. Sophie
had not spoken to Ravenel of what had happened
in the park since their agitated walk home, but
now she said timidly, placing her hand in his, in
the soft purple twilight which enveloped them, and
through which the lights of the town twinkled beneath
them:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think that man Creci will do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prefer charges against me, I suppose,&rdquo; returned
Ravenel, &ldquo;but if he does, I think he will get
the worst of it. No one could believe that you,
Sophie, could give any encouragement to a man
like that. Your life here has been too prudent.
No other woman, I believe, could have lived with
the beauty and natural gaiety that you possess,
effacing herself so completely, and all for me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>What an evil hour for you, dearest, that ever we
met!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not say that,&rdquo; cried Sophie. &ldquo;If I had it
all to live over again, I would do as I have done
except&mdash;except&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands. Ravenel, too,
looked ashamed. To both of them the iron entered
into their souls at the recollection of the first three
weeks after Sophie left her husband. Then Sophie,
raising her head, presently said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it was an evil hour for you. I might have
endured my fate, while but for me you would have
married happily, and be to-day where you ought to
be&mdash;in a good position, with your talents recognized
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two poor souls often talked together in this
way, speaking frankly to each other, and each taking
the blame. They spoke a while longer, each
fearing and dreading the morrow, and then Sophie
went to see that Lucie was asleep in her little bed,
while Ravenel went to his work of addressing envelopes.</p>

<p>Lucie was not asleep, as she should have been,
but wide-awake and very talkative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sophie,&rdquo; she said, when Sophie sat down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>by the bed in Lucie&rsquo;s little room, &ldquo;how glad I am
that you are married to Captain Ravenel! I like
him so much better than Count Delorme. Sophie,
I hated Count Delorme!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; replied Sophie, her pale face flushing,
and her tongue for once committing an indiscretion.
But the child was quite unconscious of it.
She hated Count Delorme herself, and saw every
reason why Sophie and every one else should hate
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Edouard,&rdquo; continued Lucie, &ldquo;that hateful,
hateful boy! Oh, I think it is ever so much
nicer as it is, and if only I could live with you, and
make omelettes every day, and have a little garden
and dig in it when Captain Ravenel is digging in
the big garden, how much I should like it, and then
I could go and visit grandmama at the ch&acirc;teau.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sophie laid her head down on the pillow by
Lucie, and kissed the child&rsquo;s soft red lips. After
all, how happy she could be but for that terrible
moral law which, because they had transgressed it,
kept thundering in her ears its maledictions.</p>

<p>But no shame and no sorrow can wholly take
away the joy of loving and being loved as Sophie
loved and was loved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Next morning, about seven o&rsquo;clock, as Ravenel
was walking through the park to the post-office
with his parcel of circulars, he came face to face
with Colonel Duquesne. The colonel, instead of
passing him with a stiff nod, halted before him,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Captain Ravenel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ravenel was startled, but he replied, saluting
respectfully:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is, I am afraid, some trouble ahead of
you with regard to Lieutenant Creci,&rdquo; said the
colonel, speaking very deliberately. &ldquo;I wish to
say now, from long knowledge of the lady in the
case, that I can not believe she committed the smallest
impropriety, nor do I think that Creci&rsquo;s word
that she did so would carry the slightest conviction
to any person in Bienville; and whatever comes of
it, the lady&rsquo;s name must be kept out of the affair
absolutely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ravenel could have fallen upon his knees with
gratitude when Colonel Duquesne said this. The
idea that Sophie&rsquo;s name should be dragged into a
public scandal was heart-breaking to him. The
tears came into his eyes, and he was about to extend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>his hand impulsively to Colonel Duquesne, but
changed his mind, and crossed his arms.</p>

<p>He bowed, however, profoundly, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can not express to you, sir, how much I thank
you for what you have said. It is well-deserved by
that lady, who is the most modest, the most retiring,
the purest-minded&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ravenel stopped with a lump in his throat. The
tears by that time had dropped upon his dark, sunburned
face. He brushed them away, but Colonel
Duquesne thought no less of him for those tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite of your mind,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;concerning
that lady. The circumstances are most
unfortunate. I can express to you, privately, a
degree of sympathy which I can not do publicly,
but believe me, no man could be more anxious than
I am to save that lady&rsquo;s feelings in this affair. Captain
Merrilat will wait on you this morning. I
think if you will agree to make him a very slight
apology, everything can be arranged, and, for my
part, I pledge you my word, as Lieutenant Creci&rsquo;s
commanding officer, to use all the power I possess to
induce him to accept anything in the shape of an
apology which you may offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can not apologize,&rdquo; blurted out poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>Ravenel. &ldquo;The lady in question was sitting quietly
on the bench, and did not even see Creci, and
he came up and spoke to her insultingly, and the
lady became embarrassed and alarmed, and then
he sat down by her most impudently and improperly,
and attempted to throw his arm around her,
and then I caught him and thrashed him&mdash;and am
I to apologize for that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel paused. The story which he had
overheard that naughty little boy of Madame Marcel&rsquo;s
telling the night before in the garden corresponded
exactly with what Ravenel had said,&mdash;not
that Ravenel&rsquo;s word alone needed any corroboration
with Colonel Duquesne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you must say something which
may be construed into an apology. Not a man in
the regiment sustains Creci&rsquo;s course, but for reasons
which you understand, the chief of which is
the lady in the case, it must be hushed up. I have
arranged for you to meet Creci this morning at
my house and the affair shall be settled before me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ravenel, with his soul in his eyes, looked at the
colonel, who was a man with a heart in his breast,
even though he was a colonel; and then the colonel
held out his hand. Ravenel gripped it for a mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>ment
and then hurried away through the park that
he might not miss the morning mail, for he was as
careful and prompt in the performance of his duty
with regard to these circulars, which he addressed
at next to nothing a thousand, as if it had been the
best-paid and most important work in the world.</p>

<p>But his heart was more joyful than it had been
for many a day. He had something pleasant to
take back to Sophie. When he returned, and they
had their eleven o&rsquo;clock breakfast together in the
little garden, he looked so cheerful that Sophie felt
almost gay. They sat with Lucie at the little round
table with a white cloth on it, under a big acacia
tree. Close by them were a dozen tall oleanders in
tubs, for Captain Ravenel, turning his unusual
skill in flowers to account, supplied most of the
caf&eacute;s in town with their ornamental plants. Their
breakfast was simple, but very good, and Lucie triumphed
in the production of the omelette which
was the work of her own hands. She was already
lamenting that in one week more she would have to
go back to the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard, and Madame Bernard&rsquo;s
chef.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is so nice to be with you here!&rdquo; she cried,
and then said, as she had done two or three times
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>before: &ldquo;It is so much nicer than at Ch&acirc;lons&mdash;and
I hated Count Delorme!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke the name, Ravenel looked away,
while poor Sophie blushed and trembled, but Lucie,
meaning to please her hosts, kept on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I am grown up, and get my money, I intend
to come and live with you, Sophie and Captain
Ravenel. Harper says that when I am eighteen
I shall have a whole lot of money in America that
grandmama can not keep me out of, and that I
can spend it as I like, and I will come and live in
Bienville and have a carriage and everything I
want, but I think I would like to stay in this house&mdash;it
is small, but so very pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Harper should not tell you such things, Lucie,&rdquo;
said Sophie. She looked at Captain Ravenel. It is
impossible to keep nursery governesses and upper
servants from gossiping,&mdash;how much had she told
Lucie in the past, and how much might she tell her
in the future?</p>

<p>Presently Lucie was sent away to practise on the
piano, for it was a part of Sophie&rsquo;s plan that, when
Lucie returned to her grandmother after these brief
and forced visits, the child should show some improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Ravenel told Sophie that as soon as he
finished breakfast, he was to go to Colonel Duquesne&rsquo;s
house, and have the meeting with Creci,
and he repeated the colonel&rsquo;s chivalrous words to
her. Sophie&rsquo;s pale face flamed up. It was something
in the arid waste of life to have known two
such men as the one before her and Colonel Duquesne,
who would not strike a woman when she
was helpless before him, and who pitied the weaknesses
of the human heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when it comes to apologizing,&rdquo; said Ravenel,
grinding his teeth, &ldquo;what am I to say?&mdash;to
say that I am sorry for having kicked him, when
I wished to kill him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest,&rdquo; replied Sophie, &ldquo;do what the colonel
advises. He would not counsel you to do anything
against your honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At twelve o&rsquo;clock precisely, Ravenel presented
himself at the colonel&rsquo;s house. He was in his uniform,
for, although retired, he was still an officer.
The soldiers saluted him respectfully, and the
aides spoke to him politely. Everybody felt sorry
for Ravenel, and most honest and brave men in his
place would have done as he had. He was ushered
into the colonel&rsquo;s room, and there sat Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Duquesne and Creci, with his two friends, the officers
who had dragged Ravenel and himself apart
in the park. The colonel and others present bowed
gravely to Ravenel, who returned the bow and seated
himself at the colonel&rsquo;s invitation, and then after
a little silence the colonel stated the case briefly,
but said at the end, with emphasis:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think in every case of this sort, without impugning
Lieutenant Creci&rsquo;s word, the presumption
is that a mistake has been made. Whatever Lieutenant
Creci thought about the lady in question,
whose name must, by no means, be mentioned, I
feel sure that she was unconscious of any attempt
to attract his attention. We will proceed upon
that supposition, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Creci&rsquo;s handsome, stupid face grew scarlet,
Ravenel&rsquo;s dark skin turned a shade darker, the
other two officers looked impassive. Then the colonel
went on to say that he would recommend Captain
Ravenel to make an apology to Lieutenant
Creci, and he would strongly urge Lieutenant
Creci to accept it. At that there was a long silence.
Ravenel really knew not how to apologize for having
done what his honor and his conscience and his
inclination had told him was right to do. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>blamed himself for not having stamped his foot in
Creci&rsquo;s face, and so marked him for life. The
pause became awkward while Ravenel was turning
these things over in his mind. At last, with
the colonel&rsquo;s eye fixed upon him commandingly, he
mumbled something about regretting that the occasion
had arisen&mdash;the rest of it was lost in his
mustache, for the colonel, as soon as he heard the
word regret, turned promptly to Creci. There
was a menace in Colonel Duquesne&rsquo;s eye&mdash;a look
which commanded obedience. Creci, inwardly raging,
sullenly bowed, and Captain Merrilat said
quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Lieutenant Creci accepts the apology,
and we may consider the affair as ended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody present knew what Colonel Duquesne
meant. He had known Sophie when she was fresh
from her convent school, had known her as the
young wife of an unfeeling and vicious man&mdash;he
had known her at the moment when her courage
failed her, and she had left the hard and stony path
she had been traveling with Delorme to go on a
path still hard and stony with Ravenel. Colonel
Duquesne was tender-hearted where women were
concerned, and felt in his soul that he could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>have stood Delorme as long as Sophie had stood
him. All these things were working in his mind
when Ravenel and Creci and the two officers were
rising and making their formal adieus.</p>

<p>Ravenel went home to Sophie and the two were
almost gay over the result of the affair which had
been so baneful to them in the beginning. It almost
seemed to the two poor souls as if they had
some friends left. That very afternoon, when taking
their one solitary indulgence&mdash;their walk in
the park&mdash;they passed the colonel, who bowed to
Sophie quite in the old way, although he did not
speak. The colonel was a widower with no daughters
and, therefore, was quite safe in doing this, not
having a domestic court of inquiry ahead of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2></div>

<p>Lucie had only four days more to remain in
Bienville, but, except for the approaching parting
from Sophie and Ravenel, they were indeed very
happy days to her. The child&rsquo;s active and aggressive
little mind, which was part of her American
inheritance, dwelt on that charming vision which
Harper, with the usual indiscretion of servants and
nursery governesses, had shown her&mdash;that vision of
all the money she wished to spend, which would be
hers at eighteen, with no one, not even Madame
Bernard, to interfere.</p>

<p>Lucie enjoyed another stolen interview with Paul
Verney, for this young lady, at ten years of age,
was a well-developed flirt and romanticist. Not all
her French training had been able to get the American
out of her, and she had with it all the generous
impulses and the happy daring with which the
American child seems to be dowered.</p>

<p>Paul Verney, in his afternoon walks, had the
pleasure of bowing twice to Captain and Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Ravenel, but neither time was Lucie with them.
On the afternoon before Lucie left Bienville, she
was walking with the Ravenels, Harper, as usual,
in the distance. Lucie, with the ingenuity peculiar
to her age and sex, determined to go on a search
for Paul Verney, and so arranged her plans with
much art.</p>

<p>She asked Sophie if Harper could take her to the
fountain in the park to see the little fishes swim in
the basin. This reasonable proposal being agreed
to, Harper took Lucie by the hand, and off they
went. Once at the fountain, around which there
were benches, Harper was sure to find some of her
colleagues, and Lucie, providing she reported at
the end of every ten minutes, was certain of an hour
of liberty.</p>

<p>Lucie utilized her first ten minutes by finding
Paul Verney. There he was, sitting on the same
bench and reading the same English book as on the
first afternoon that she had spoken to him. When
Paul saw his lady-love approach he rose and
blushed and smiled, and Lucie bowed and smiled,
without blushing, however. Seating herself on the
bench, and settling her fluffy white skirts around
her, she said to Paul with a queenly air:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You may sit down.&rdquo; Then she added, quite
seriously, &ldquo;I am going away to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s boyish heart gave a jump. He was secretly
very much afraid of Lucie, and disapproved of
her&mdash;but she was so fascinating, and life at Bienville
would seem so different after she went away.
He stammered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I shall come back,&rdquo; said Lucie in a sprightly
tone. &ldquo;You see, it is so very easy to frighten
grandmama. All I have to do is to stop eating for
two days, and it really isn&rsquo;t so bad at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul Verney, although not a greedy youngster
like Toni, thought that to go without eating for
two days was a very severe test of affection, but it
was like everything else about Lucie, dashing and
daring, and quite out of the common. He replied
timidly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, Mademoiselle, you won&rsquo;t make yourself
ill. It always makes me ill to go without my dinner
even.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Lucie, &ldquo;that is when your
mama punishes you&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul blushed more deeply than ever. He wished
to appear a man, and here was Lucie reminding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>him that he was, after all, only a little boy. Then
Lucie asked him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to be when you grow up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A soldier, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Paul, straightening
himself up involuntarily. &ldquo;I am going to
the cavalry school at St. Cyr. I shall ride a fine
horse like the officers here in Bienville. I told papa
and mama my last birthday, and they are quite
willing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it will be a long time yet,&rdquo; said Lucie,
&ldquo;won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so very long,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;In four years
I shall go to the cavalry school, and then in four
years more I shall be graduated, and then I shall
be a lieutenant, and have a sword, and wear a helmet
with a horse-hair plume in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The picture which Paul unconsciously drew of
himself was very attractive to the imaginative
Lucie. She looked at him meditatively, and wondered
how he would look when he was grown up,
with his sword and horse-hair plume. Paul was not
particularly handsome, but his somewhat stocky
figure was well-knit, and he looked unqualifiedly
clean and honest&mdash;two great recommendations in
any man or boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;By the time you are a lieutenant with a sword,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;I shall be a young lady with a long
train and I shall be very rich. Harper told me so,
and then I am coming to Bienville, and I will buy
the commandant&rsquo;s house, and have the finest carriage
in Bienville, and have a ball every night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul listened to this with a sudden sinking of
the heart. The realization came to him, as much
as if he had been twenty instead of twelve years old,
that this splendid picture which Lucie drew of her
future did not accord with his, the son of a Bienville
advocate, who lived in a modest house and
whose mother made most of her own gowns. And
besides that, he did not like, and did not understand
Lucie&rsquo;s innocent bragging. He was a sweet,
sensible boy, with a practical French mind, who
never bragged about anything in his life, and who
did heroic, boyish things in the most matter-of-fact
manner in the world, and never thought they were
heroic. But Lucie was so charming! Like many a
grown up man his judgment and his heart went
different ways. Lucie had his heart&mdash;there was no
question about it.</p>

<p>Lucie would have liked to stay a long time with
Paul, and Paul would have enjoyed staying with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Lucie, but, looking up, he saw his father and
mother approaching, on their way to the terrace,
where, like all the other inhabitants of Bienville,
they spent their summer afternoons having ices or
drinking tea and listening to the music. The Verneys
were a comfortable-looking couple, fond of
each other and adoring Paul. They smiled when
they saw Paul seated on the bench and the charming
little girl talking to him. They knew it was none
of Paul&rsquo;s doing, for he was afraid of girls and always
ran away from them.</p>

<p>As his father and mother drew nearer, Paul&rsquo;s
impulse to rush away, in order to avoid being seen
with Lucie, almost overpowered him, but he was at
heart a courageous boy, and a chivalrous one, and
he thought it would be cowardly to run off; so he
stood, or rather sat his ground with apparent boldness,
but his face was reddening and his heart
thumping as his father and mother approached.
Lucie, however, was not at all timid, and when she
saw Monsieur and Madame Verney coming so close,
asked Paul who they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my father and mother,&rdquo; said Paul in a
shaky voice, opening his book with much embarrassment
and turning over its pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I think they look very nice,&rdquo; said Lucie, &ldquo;and
see, they are smiling at you. I think they are smiling
at you because you are talking to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s head went down still lower on his book,
and his face burned crimson. Lucie, with great
self-possession, got up from the bench, and, making
a pretty little bow to Monsieur and Madame
Verney, skipped off back to Harper.</p>

<p>Monsieur Verney, a pleasant-faced man of fifty,
prodded Paul with his cane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What charming young lady was that, my son,
with whom you were speaking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Lucie Bernard,&rdquo; Paul managed to
articulate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a very pretty little thing she is!&rdquo; said
Madame Verney, who was, herself, pretty and
pleasant-looking, sitting down on the bench, and
putting Paul&rsquo;s blushing face upon her shoulder.
&ldquo;For shame, Charles, to tease the boy so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul hid his face on his mother&rsquo;s shoulder, meanwhile
screwing up his courage to its ultimate point.
Then, raising his head, and looking his father
directly in the eye, Paul said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I grow up, I mean to marry Mademoiselle
Lucie.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy&rsquo;s clear blue eyes looked directly into his
father&rsquo;s, which were also clear and blue, and between
the boy and the man a look of sympathy, of
understanding, passed. His father might laugh at
him, but Paul knew that it was only a joke, after
all, and as long as he behaved himself, no unkind
word would be spoken to him by that excellent father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said Monsieur Verney to Madame Verney,
&ldquo;so we are promised a daughter-in-law already!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That pleases me very much,&rdquo; said Madame Verney,
smiling. &ldquo;I hope that Mademoiselle Lucie
will grow up as good as she is pretty, and then I
shall be very glad to have her for a daughter-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then his mother kissed him, and Paul got up
and walked on with his father and mother, holding
a hand of each and wondering if any boy ever
had such a kind father and mother. They joked
him about Lucie, but Paul did not mind that. He
rather liked it, now that the murder was out. Presently,
when Paul had gone off to play and the Verneys
were sitting at a little table by themselves on
the terrace, Monsieur Verney suddenly fell into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>brown study, and, after a few minutes, bringing
his fist down on the table and making the glasses
ring, said to Madame Verney:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know who that little girl is now&mdash;I could not
place her at first. She is the half-sister of Madame
Ravenel. The child is allowed to visit her once a
year&mdash;what can the family be thinking of to permit
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Verney knew Sophie Ravenel&rsquo;s history
perfectly well, as did everybody in Bienville, and
she knew more than most people; for she said to
Monsieur Verney:</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the time when Madame Delorme left her
husband for Ravenel, this child, whom she had
brought up from her birth, was taken away from
her by her grandmother, their father&rsquo;s mother,
who is also the grandmother of Madame Ravenel.
This little girl&rsquo;s mother was an American, I am
told. The child, I know, has been permitted to
visit Madame Ravenel before, but this will scarcely
be allowed after she is two or three years older.
I have also heard that she has a large fortune
through her mother, in her own right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this the great maternal instinct welled up in
Madame Verney&rsquo;s heart. Why should not her Paul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>the best of boys, marry a girl with a large fortune
and a position like Lucie&rsquo;s, which was far above
Paul&rsquo;s? She began to dream about Paul&rsquo;s matrimonial
prospects&mdash;dreams which had begun when he
was a little pink baby lying in his cradle. The Verneys
were not rich, nor distinguished, nor was there
anything except love which would be likely to provide
Paul with a wife suitable to his merits. Madame
Verney, following up this dream concerning
Paul, began secretly to pity Madame Ravenel, and
argued that, after all, nothing about that unfortunate
lady could reflect on Lucie.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lucie, kneeling down on the edge of
the basin of the fountain, looked into it and saw
there a church brilliantly lighted, with palms and
flowers all about, and full of gaily-dressed ladies
and officers in uniform. And then the organ sounded
and up the aisle came marching herself, in a
white satin gown and lace veil; and she leaned on
the arm of a young officer with a sword and a helmet
with a horse-hair plume in it, and he had the
honest eyes of Paul Verney.</p>

<p>At the end of the week Lucie vanished from
Paul&rsquo;s sight, but not from his memory. According
to all the laws of fitness, Paul, the most honest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>straightforward, matter-of-fact, obedient little fellow
in the world, should have found his counterpart
in the shape of another Denise Duval of his own
class; for little Denise was as honest, as correct, as
matter-of-fact and as obedient as Paul Verney.
But, behold how it works! Paul fell in love with
the vivacious, sprightly, charming Lucie, while
Toni had determined to link his fate with the irreproachable
and demure Denise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2></div>

<p>The summer waned and the autumn began and
then a great shock came to Toni&mdash;two great shocks,
in fact. First Paul Verney, who, next to Jacques,
was Toni&rsquo;s best friend, was sent away to boarding-school.
Toni felt a horrible sense of loss and emptiness.
In losing Paul, he seemed to lose a protector
as well as a friend. He had not been so much
afraid of other people when Paul was about, but
now he was more afraid of them than ever. And
then, Toni, being a strong, robust fellow for his
age, it was forced upon Madame Marcel that, as
he would not go to school, he must learn a trade.</p>

<p>Madame Marcel was ambitious for Toni and
shed many tears over his determination not to
make a walking encyclopedia of himself if he could
help it. What was the use of his learning to work,
anyhow? When he married Denise, as he fully intended
to do, they could live over Mademoiselle
Duval&rsquo;s shop and eat cakes and tarts for dinner
and candies for breakfast and supper. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>the bench under the acacia tree close by Mademoiselle
Duval&rsquo;s shop, and Toni expected to spend his
adult life sitting on that bench, in the summer
time, with Denise and eating cakes, and in the winter
time sitting in his mother&rsquo;s warm kitchen licking
candy kettles.</p>

<p>It was a very grave matter to select a trade for
Toni. Madame Marcel had aspirations for him
which were not shared, however, by anybody else;
for all the persons with whom she talked concerning
Toni&rsquo;s future were quite brutal, so his poor
mother thought, and recommended putting the boy
to doing hard work for which his strong little legs
and arms and back well fitted him. But Madame
Marcel secretly yearned to see her Toni a gentleman,
though at the same time she had not the courage
to advance this proposition in any way. So
she thought as a compromise between a trade and
a profession she would make Toni a musician&mdash;a
violinist, in short.</p>

<p>When this was broached to Toni, he objected to
it, as he did to every suggestion that he should do
anything except amuse himself, talk with Jacques
and hang around the horses at the cavalry barracks.
His mother, however, for once showed some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>determination, and Toni, finding that he absolutely
had to learn to work, begged and prayed that he
might be allowed to work about the one livery
stable in the town of Bienville. Toni really did
not think he would mind feeding and currying
horses, he loved them so much&mdash;almost as much
as Jacques and Paul Verney&mdash;and, like Jacques,
they were interested listeners&mdash;more interested than
most of the people he knew. Madame Marcel
would by no means consent to this, and urged on
Toni the advantage of playing first violin in the
orchestra of the theater, like Hermann, the yellow-haired
Swiss, who was first violinist at the Bienville
theater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call that work,&rdquo; asked Toni indignantly,
as if he were already a captain of industry&mdash;&ldquo;sitting
there and fiddling for amusement? Why,
mama, that isn&rsquo;t work at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s just amusement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do you object to it?&rdquo; asked Madame
Marcel helplessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is not work,&rdquo; replied Toni boldly.
&ldquo;When I work, I want to work&mdash;currying horses
or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But have you no ambition?&rdquo; cried poor Madame
Marcel. &ldquo;Do you want to be a mere hostler?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>Toni&rsquo;s mind had not projected itself very far.
He knew that he would have to serve his time in
the army, and it had occurred to him that he would
certainly be put in the cavalry, and he said as much
to his mother. But Madame Marcel, who could
not persuade herself that Toni was not an innocent
and guileless creature, could not endure the
thought of turning him loose in a stable, to bear
the kicks and cuffs, the jokes and jeers, of a lot of
rough stablemen.</p>

<p>She asked Toni if he would be willing to learn
the trade of a tailor. Clery, the tailor, lived opposite
them, and was a very respectable man, who
made a good living for his family. But Toni
hastily objected to this&mdash;he was afraid of the five
Clery boys.</p>

<p>So Madame Marcel and Toni kept going around
in a circle for many days and weeks. Finally Madame
Marcel one morning, taking Toni by his
hand, having washed him clean for once, and
dressed him in his best Sunday suit, carried him off
to see Monsieur Hermann, the Swiss, in regard to
converting Toni into a second Sarasate or Ysaye.
Hermann lived in two little rooms at the top of a
rickety old tenement, and Toni&rsquo;s heart sank as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>climbed the stairs, holding on tightly to his mother&rsquo;s
hand. He did not like Hermann&rsquo;s looks&mdash;a
big, blue-eyed Swiss, who imagined that he resembled
Lohengrin and Siegfried, and dressed the part
as well as he was able by cultivating a head of long
curly blond hair and a huge blond beard.</p>

<p>Madame Marcel explained, as mothers are apt to
do under similar circumstances, that, finding Toni
totally unfitted for anything else, she had determined
to make a musician of him. Hermann smiled.
There was nothing of the artistic temperament
visible in that tousled head of black hair, those
bright, dark eyes which changed their expression
as quickly as the little river under the stone bridge
changed its look on an April day of sun and rain.
And Toni had hard, muscular little hands, which
did not seem to Hermann as if they could ever
wield the magic bow. Toni himself looked sulky.
He had no mind to be a fiddler, and did not mean
to learn. However, his mother arranged that he
should go the next day to take his first lesson, and
then they went down stairs, Toni clattering ahead.</p>

<p>He rushed off to the cavalry barracks at the other
end of the town. It was the time for feeding the
hundreds of horses in the long rows of stalls, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Toni had a few happy moments, crawling in and
out as the troopers would let him, quite regardless
of the Sunday suit. Oh, if he could only live
with horses all the time instead of people! Now
that Paul Verney was gone, he felt that it was useless
for him to try to have a talking friend. But
horses could understand perfectly well, and he could
find much greater companionship in a horse than
in a fiddle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo2"><img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;Told him to go home to his mother and tell her that she had
an ass for a son.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Told him to go home to his mother and tell her that she had
an ass for a son.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">He firmly resolved not to go next morning to
take his music lesson if he could possibly help it;
but when the time came he could not help it, and he
started off, at a snail&rsquo;s pace, for Hermann&rsquo;s lodging.
Hermann, leaning out of his window, saw
Toni come slouching along, looking as if he were
going to his execution. He scowled at Hermann,
leaning out of the window. Few small boys love
lessons on the violin, which is a difficult instrument,
but well worth giving one&rsquo;s days and nights
to, thought Hermann. When Toni finally appeared,
he was the image of stolidity and stupidity.
Hermann put a violin in his hands, and tried
to explain the scale to him, but Toni was hopelessly
inept. He could not understand those queer-looking
things called notes. His mind wandered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>the riding-school, where he knew the troopers were
going through their exercises. He thought of the
day he took that glorious wild ride on the old cavalry
charger. He began to wonder what Paul
Verney was doing, and reflected that it would be
well for him to frame an excuse some time that day
to go into Mademoiselle Duval&rsquo;s shop, so she would
give him a bun.</p>

<p>It may be imagined to what a pass Toni&rsquo;s state
of mind reduced poor Hermann, who finally rapped
him smartly over the head with the violin bow, and
told him to go home to his mother and tell her that
she had an ass for a son. Toni, at the first rap
from the bow, which did not hurt him in the least,
howled terrifically, and, rushing off home to his
mother, told her, between his sobs, a harrowing tale
of how Hermann had beaten him most cruelly with
the violin bow. However, Madame Marcel could
not find a scratch on him to corroborate Toni&rsquo;s
sensational tale, and flatly refused to believe him.
In spite of Toni&rsquo;s protests, he was sent back to
Hermann&rsquo;s lodgings for his music book and the
little violin which Madame Marcel had asked Hermann
to provide for the boy. He returned home,
carrying both music book and violin, those instru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>ments
of torture, and seriously considered studying
tailoring after all, as two of the Clery boys
were doing. But Clery made his boys work, and
Toni had great hopes that Hermann would never
be able to get any work out of him.</p>

<p>Little Denise, who was soft-hearted, had seen him
coming and going in his pursuit of an artistic
career, and her heart was touched at the spectacle
of Toni&rsquo;s unhappiness. When he came home that
second day, Denise was sitting on the bench under
the acacia tree and was knitting industriously. Denise
had all the virtues which Toni lacked. As
Toni approached, his head hanging sullenly down,
Denise held out her hand and in it was a little piece
of stale tart. This brightened Toni up, and, sitting
down by Denise, he told her a moving story
of the cruelties he had suffered at Hermann&rsquo;s hands,
adding several atrocities to the original ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor, poor Toni! I feel so sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to,&rdquo; replied Toni, deeply touched
by his own eloquence, and beginning to cry. &ldquo;That
man will beat me to death some day, I know he will,
and I hope he will, too, because then even my
mother will be sorry she sent me to learn the fiddle.
O-o-o-o-h!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duval interrupted this tender scene
by coming out and calling to Toni:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You good-for-nothing little boy, why don&rsquo;t you
go home and practise the violin and mind your
mother? Oh, I warrant Madame Marcel will see
trouble with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni concluded that when he married Denise he
would see as little as possible of his aunt-in-law as
well as his father-in-law.</p>

<p>He went back the next day, and many days after.
For weeks and months honest Hermann strove
with the boy, but Toni simply would not learn the
violin. However, a strange thing happened&mdash;he
found he could talk to Hermann, and was not afraid
of him, and Hermann discovered that this lazy,
idle, dirty, bright-eyed, insinuating urchin, who
had no ear for music, had some strangely companionable
qualities. Toni even grew intimate enough
with Hermann to tell him all about Jacques, and
actually was courageous enough to show that
redoubtable warrior to his friend. He told Hermann
also of his friendships with horses and said
to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I feel as if you were a horse&mdash;a
great big sorrel cart-horse.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Hermann threw back his head, and opened his
great mouth and laughed at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am not the least afraid of you,&rdquo; continued
Toni, &ldquo;and that is very queer, because I am
so afraid of people, except Paul Verney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall I tell you,&rdquo; said Hermann, laughing
and twisting his hands in the boy&rsquo;s shock of black
hair, &ldquo;what I think you are like? A monkey&mdash;except
that you have not sense enough to learn to
dance, as a monkey does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni was delighted at this. Then he said quite
gravely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Monsieur Hermann, of any business
a boy can learn that will give him all he wants
to eat, and plenty of time to amuse himself, and
not make him work, and support him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Hermann. &ldquo;Marry a young
lady with a large fortune. That gives a man
enough to do, but yet it is not called work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had already made up my mind to that,&rdquo; said
Toni seriously, &ldquo;I am going&mdash;now don&rsquo;t tell anybody
this&mdash;I am going to marry little Denise Duval,
and we are going to live part of the time with
Mademoiselle Duval and eat cakes, and the rest
of the time with my mother and eat candies.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho-ho!&rdquo; laughed Hermann, who had a great,
big, joyous laugh, &ldquo;what a clever arrangement&mdash;and
Mademoiselle Duval has agreed to this, and
her niece, and your mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mother will agree to anything I say, and
Mademoiselle Duval will agree to anything Denise
says, but I have not asked Denise yet&mdash;she is so
young, you know, she doesn&rsquo;t understand anything
about these things, but I shall marry her just the
same. If I ever have a wife, I mean that she shall
be nice, and clean, and good, and stay at home and
work hard. Women ought to work hard, you know,
Monsieur Hermann.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hermann shouted out again&mdash;his great roaring
laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are, after all, not such a little idiot as I
supposed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Denise will no
doubt work and keep you in idleness. Now play
your scale,&rdquo;&mdash;and then Toni played his scale&mdash;a
terrible scale, that began and ended nowhere, and
which caused Hermann to grind his teeth. He
caught Toni and shook him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Play that scale again, you little rascal!&rdquo; he
roared, and Toni played it worse than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried Hermann, &ldquo;to think of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>teaching you the violin! I might just as well try to
teach one of the horses in the riding-school&mdash;I am
sure any of the horses could play as well as you
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni listened to this, and was pleased. He had
no notion of learning to play the violin, but he had
learned to like coming to Hermann&rsquo;s lodging and
talking about all sorts of things, particularly as he
had no one else whom he could talk to.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Madame Marcel was delighted when
she found that Toni, after a while, grew to make
no objections to going to take his music lesson.
He learned so little, however, that Hermann, who
was an honest fellow, began to have conscientious
scruples about taking Madame Marcel&rsquo;s money for
Toni&rsquo;s lessons.</p>

<p>At the end of six months Hermann went to Madame
Marcel and told her frankly that Toni could
never become a Sarasate or an Ysaye, and made
the same comparison about teaching a horse to
play the fiddle as easily as he could teach Toni.
Madame Marcel looked at him with wondering eyes.
Toni professed to be so anxious to learn. That
young person had discovered that spending an
hour each day doing nothing, with Hermann&rsquo;s big,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>kindly face to look into, and being able to tell
things to some one who could understand as Paul
Verney did, was really a great scheme. Then he
would always spend another hour going the half-mile
to Hermann&rsquo;s house, and an hour coming back,
and he could always invent a plausible excuse for
taking so long; and he had no mind in the world to
give up his once-dreaded music lessons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he is so fond of his music!&rdquo; pleaded Madame
Marcel. &ldquo;He loves to take his lesson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; cried Hermann. &ldquo;That boy is fooling
you, Madame Marcel. He fooled me for a little
while, but he is not learning anything&mdash;he does
not mean to learn anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He likes you so much!&rdquo; wailed Madame Marcel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I like him&mdash;the idle little rascal!&rdquo; replied
Hermann good-humoredly. &ldquo;He is the queerest
little chap, and I like to talk to him. You are
paying your good money for that, Madame Marcel&mdash;he
is not learning to play the violin&mdash;he never
will learn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Marcel sighed, and a great gloom fell
on her. She thought she had solved the problem
of Toni&rsquo;s future, and here it was rising up before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>her, even more complex and more appalling than
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think it would do any good,&rdquo; she asked
anxiously, &ldquo;if I were to whip Toni?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit, Madame,&rdquo; replied Hermann. &ldquo;Perhaps
if you let me thrash him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the second proposal of the kind which
Madame Marcel had received, the other one being
that offer of Sergeant Duval&rsquo;s to become a father
to Toni, and to give him all the thrashings he
richly deserved. Some idea of the same sort flashed
into her head, and at the same moment it came into
Hermann&rsquo;s mind. He had grown so unreasonably
fond of the little rascal, and what a pity it was that
the boy should not be made to learn and to behave
himself! So he said sentimentally to Madame Marcel,
with almost the same words and exactly the
same meaning which Sergeant Duval had:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, you ought to marry in order that
Toni may have a man&rsquo;s strong hand to control him.
If I could aspire&rdquo;&mdash;for Hermann was as poor as
poverty, and Madame Marcel, with her candy shop,
was comfortably off for a widow with one child.
Madame Marcel shook her head. Sergeant Duval
was far more attractive to her than this big, hulk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>ing,
blond violinist, but not even the dashing sergeant
could win her on his promise to give Toni
his deserts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur,&rdquo; said Madame Marcel, fingering
her apron as girlish blushes came into her face, &ldquo;I
am not thinking of changing my condition. My
life shall be devoted to Toni, and as I firmly believe
that he has great talent for music, and really tries
to learn, if you will continue to let him go to you,
I shall be delighted, and consider it a favor from
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, Madame,&rdquo; replied Hermann, in a
tone of resignation, &ldquo;if you wish to throw your
money away, you may pay it to me, for God knows
I need it. But I assure you, I might just as well
undertake to teach the town pump to play the
violin as your Toni, and Toni has no more notion
of learning to play than the town pump has. Good
morning, Madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni, in this affair, scored a brilliant victory over
his mother and Hermann. For two whole years
more he kept up this delightful farce of learning
to play the violin, and in that time he learned
one little air&mdash;<i>Sur le Pont d&rsquo;Avignon</i>&mdash;which he
played in a most excruciating manner, flatting his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>notes terrifically, and playing with a reckless disregard
of time, which almost broke poor Hermann&rsquo;s
heart. When Toni played this air for the first
time before his mother, on a summer afternoon, the
good soul began to doubt, for the first time,
whether Toni could be made a great musician. Sergeant
Duval, happening to be at home on his annual
leave, heard these strange sounds proceeding
from Madame Marcel&rsquo;s kitchen behind the shop,
and came over in great alarm, explaining that he
heard weird noises and feared that Madame Marcel
had perhaps fallen into a fit. Madame Marcel
was highly offended at this notion of Toni&rsquo;s
performance, and directed Toni to play <i>Sur le Pont
d&rsquo;Avignon</i> for the sergeant, who listened gravely
to Toni&rsquo;s scraping and caterwauling, his only comment
on it being:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have known a man to be shot for less than
that.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2></div>

<p>In the summer Paul Verney came home from
boarding-school. He was much taller and broader
than he had been before, much improved in mind,
but the same kind, brave, gentle Paul. He was
overjoyed to see Toni again, and the two lads, on
meeting, hugged each other, or rather Toni hugged
Paul; for although Paul was tender-hearted, he
was undemonstrative and felt the dignity of his
fourteen years and his two terms at boarding-school.
Not so with Toni, who had no sense of personal
dignity whatever.</p>

<p>At once their old relations were established and
the two lads spent many hours together, as they
had done in summers past, cuddled together on
the abutment of the bridge, and telling each other
long stories, Paul of his experiences at boarding-school,
and Toni, stories of what Jacques had told
him, and what Hermann had told him, and what
the horses told him, and what he meant to be when
he was a man. He confided to Paul the charm of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>learning to play the violin, and shocked Paul&rsquo;s
honest soul by the frank acknowledgment that
learning the violin was a means to avoid going to
work.</p>

<p>But this made no difference in Paul&rsquo;s feelings.
He hated dirty, idle boys in general, but loved the
dirty, idle Toni, and, being by nature correct,
methodical, and orderly, he adored the two most
unconventional creatures ever put into this world,
little Lucie Bernard and Toni.</p>

<p>In due time Lucie also came for her annual visit,
accompanied by the wooden-faced Harper, the
nursery governess. Lucie sometimes passed Paul
in the street, and always bowed and smiled at him
in the most captivating way, which caused Paul&rsquo;s
face to turn scarlet, and sent his boyish pulses galloping.
He confided to his mother&rsquo;s ear that Lucie
had arrived, and for the fortnight that she stayed
he haunted the park every afternoon. He was now
promoted to long trousers, and felt his dignity
very much. He longed for an opportunity to talk
with Lucie, but as the case often is, all the arrangements
for private interviews had to be made by the
lady. Lucie was an ingenious little person, and not
easily daunted, and it was not many days before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>she managed to escape from Harper&rsquo;s eagle eye,
and from Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s gentle supervision,
and to come upon Paul, walking soberly along the
path, and secretly wishing for her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Monsieur Verney?&rdquo; said Lucie,
dropping him a pretty little curtsey. &ldquo;How tall
you are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul bowed, and managed to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, too, have grown, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I have,&rdquo; answered Lucie briskly, &ldquo;and
next year my hair is to be plaited.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She shook her rich, brown locks that hung down
to her waist, and were tied half-way with a bright
scarlet ribbon, and Paul thought in his heart it
was a shame to hide such beautiful hair in a plait,
such as little Denise Duval wore, and the tailor&rsquo;s
children; and he much preferred Lucie&rsquo;s hair hanging
free, with the scarlet bow bobbing up and down.
And then, the dancing scarlet bow seemed, in some
way, to match her eyes, which had a gleam of fire
in them and which were always dancing and full
of life, and her little, sensitive mouth, which was
always smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear you have been to boarding-school,&rdquo; said
Lucie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; answered Paul, quite timidly,
as if he were the young lady, and Lucie the bold
and ardent suitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think yourself quite a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mademoiselle, I am only a boy yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go to school&mdash;I have masters,&rdquo; said
Lucie, &ldquo;and a visiting governess who comes to the
Ch&acirc;teau Bernard to teach me geography and history
and things&mdash;but let me tell you, Paul,&rdquo;&mdash;here
Lucie dropped into a confidential tone and came
quite close to Paul, and put her rosy lips to his
ear, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to learn anything except English
and music. English is no trouble at all, because
Sophie always spoke English to me, and I love
music, although it is very hard work, but Sophie
made me practise on the piano until I can play it
quite well, but for the other things&mdash;I don&rsquo;t care
whether I know them or not. My governess goes
and complains to grandmama that I won&rsquo;t learn,
and then grandmama sends for me and scolds me,
and then I kiss her and tell her I will do better, and
that makes grandmama happy&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t care
to learn out of books, Paul&mdash;that is the truth&mdash;I
like to read stories, but they won&rsquo;t let me read
stories, not even Sophie.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul looked at Lucie and sighed heavily. Was
she another Toni, masquerading in girls&rsquo; clothes?
He could not understand, to save his life, these
children who did not like to study and learn, and
why they would not try to please their governesses
and parents by trying, nor could he understand
why the two beings destined to be nearest to his
soul should be so different in these respects from his
ideals. Paul could not fathom this, but it troubled
him very much indeed, and forthwith he said a few
words to Lucie something like those he had said
to Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mademoiselle, one ought to learn&mdash;indeed
one should&mdash;particularly if your grandmother and
your sister Sophie wish you to do it. I don&rsquo;t mind
learning in the least&mdash;I am going into the army,
and if I don&rsquo;t study and can&rsquo;t pass the army examinations,
I shall have to be a clerk or something
of that sort&mdash;my parents are not rich, you know&mdash;so
I must learn all I can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tra la la,&rdquo; cried Lucie, stopping in the path,
and doing a skirt dance, fluffing her voluminous little
skirts up and down as she had seen a young lady
do at the circus; &ldquo;you are a boy, and you have to
learn. Who was that black-eyed, dirty little boy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>I saw walking with you on the street the other
day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was Toni,&rdquo; answered Paul, and proceeded
to tell who Toni was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is he fond of learning, too?&rdquo; asked Lucie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; sighed Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he must be just like me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul burst into a sudden fit of laughter at the
idea of Toni and Lucie being alike. Lucie seemed
to him like a little princess out of a story-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you what, Paul,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;when I
am eighteen, as I told you once before, I shall have
heaps and heaps of money from America that I can
do with as I please, and nobody can stop me, and
I made up my mind, a long time ago, that I am
coming to Bienville to live with Sophie and Captain
Ravenel&mdash;oh, I do love them so much&mdash;they
are so good to me! Then you will be an officer, and
you will have a beautiful sword, and a helmet with
a horse-hair plume in it like the officers I see walking
about here, and then I shall go to a ball, and
some one will bring you up and introduce you to
me, and say, &lsquo;Mademoiselle, may I introduce Lieutenant
Verney?&rsquo; and then I shall bow to you as if I
never saw you before, and then you will say, &lsquo;Mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>emoiselle,
will you do me the honor to give me this
dance?&rsquo; and we shall dance together, and then
when nobody can hear, we shall talk about having
known each other always, and it will be our secret,
and no one will know it but ourselves. Won&rsquo;t it be
charming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul looked at Lucie with a new, strange light
in his eyes. Lucie, although quite unknown to
herself, was much further along the path to womanhood
than Paul was to manhood, but she seemed to
be showing him some charming, prophetic vision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you must not mention to a soul,&rdquo; said
Lucie, &ldquo;that you ever spoke one word to me before,
and I will not tell any one that I ever spoke one
word to you before. I was afraid to tell Sophie
that I had talked with you, because she would be
vexed with me, and would not give me another
chance to get away from her. So let us agree never
to mention each other&rsquo;s names to any one, but every
summer we shall meet at Bienville, and then, when
we are grown up, we shall be introduced, but we
shall know each other all the time, and then when
nobody is listening, I shall call you Paul and you
will call me Lucie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>More strange, new, delicious feelings crept into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>the boy&rsquo;s heart as Lucie said these words. Paul and
Lucie! He knew very well that when grown people
called each other by their names they were very intimate,
and how sweet it would be to know Lucie
well enough for that; and besides, if they never
called each other by their names except when they
were alone, they would escape being teased. So
Paul said, calling her for the first time by her
name:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucie, you won&rsquo;t forget this, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Paul,&rdquo; said Lucie, suddenly dropping her
gay and saucy air, and speaking quite sweetly and
demurely.</p>

<p>And then, having turned a leaf in the book of
life, they parted. Lucie heard Harper&rsquo;s voice calling
her, and Paul hurried away, his heart full of
a singular rapture. How enticing the future looked
to him! How he longed to be a man and an officer!
And he meant to be a good officer, too, so that people
would praise him to Lucie. He hurried through
the park and past the edge of the town into the
fields beyond, and on to the stone bridge, and,
climbing up into the place where he and Toni had
so often huddled together, sat there, lost in a delicious
dream. It was an August afternoon, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>the summer air was still and perfumed. In the
purple woods on the other side of the water the
birds were chirping sweetly, and under the bridge
the little fishes were tumbling about in the dark
water.</p>

<p>All these sights and sounds entered into the boy&rsquo;s
soul. The bell had been rung for the curtain to
go up for this boy on the great tragi-comedy of
human life. He sat there until the shadows grew
long and the west was flaming, when, looking at
the silver watch in his pocket, he realized that it
was almost supper-time, and that he would have
to run home to keep his mother from being uneasy.
So he started at once.</p>

<p>As he scampered along the street in which Toni
lived he saw, standing under an acacia tree close
by Mademoiselle Duval&rsquo;s shop, Toni and Denise
Duval. Denise, as clean, as modest, as pretty as
ever, was generously dividing a bun with Toni, and
Toni&mdash;oh wonder!&mdash;was giving Denise two whole
sticks of candy, only biting off one small piece for
himself. Paul stopped, astounded at the spectacle.
Usually it was Toni who gobbled up everything
which Denise gave him, and now, oh, miracle, Toni
was voluntarily giving up something to Denise. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>was in truth an epoch-making day in Toni&rsquo;s
life!</p>

<p>During the rest of Lucie&rsquo;s visit, she and Paul
several times spoke together, and every time it was
Paul who said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucie, don&rsquo;t forget that when we grow up we
are to call each other Paul and Lucie,&rdquo;&mdash;and every
time Lucie responded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you forget, Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul, who secretly mourned over Lucie&rsquo;s depravity,
talked to her quite seriously about refusing to
learn geography and spelling and arithmetic and
other rudiments of a young lady&rsquo;s education. Lucie
listened and, for the first time in her life, felt herself
impelled by a will stronger than her own.
None of the governesses and masters who had ever
taught her had been able to impress her with the
necessity of learning, nor, indeed, did Paul, for
that matter, because Lucie by no means considered
that geography and spelling and arithmetic were
essential to a polite education. But Paul had an
influence over her, nay, a sort of authority.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo3"><img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;Giving Denise two whole sticks of candy..&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Giving Denise two whole sticks of candy.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">As Lucie gazed at him, she gradually acquired
an expression that a dog has for a kind master.
For the first time in her life she found it easier to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>give up her own will than to persist in it. This
feeling was but a gleam, but it was not evanescent.</p>

<p>It was one of the happiest visits Lucie had ever
paid in Bienville, for Sophie seemed a little more
like her old self, and Captain Ravenel, too, was
more cheerful. The story of the stand that
Colonel Duquesne had taken about Madame Ravenel
had leaked out mysteriously, and there was no
danger of any further impertinence being offered
Sophie Ravenel. The retired and blameless and
self-sacrificing life the Ravenels led was beginning
to be known. The ultra-virtuous still hounded Madame
Ravenel over their tea-cups in the winter and
their ices in the summer; but, although no one had
invaded the retirement of the Ravenels so far, a
number of people had begun the practice of speaking
to them as they passed, and they were no longer
avoided.</p>

<p>They even reached the point of courage to go
sometimes and sit on the terrace, where the band
played, and where the people sat at little tables,
eating and drinking. One afternoon, shortly after
Lucie had left, they were actually invited to sit at
the same table with the Verneys. The Ravenels
walked on the terrace, evidently looking for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>table, but there was not a vacant one. There were,
however, two unoccupied seats where Monsieur
and Madame Verney and Paul sat, drinking
<i>eau sucré</i>. The Ravenels were about to leave,
when Madame Verney whispered something to her
husband. Monsieur Verney at first shook his head,
but Madame Verney persisted. That dream of her
Paul marrying the beautiful, charming heiress into
which Lucie Bernard was certain to develop had
haunted the good woman&rsquo;s brain, and she urged
her husband, in a whisper, to invite the Ravenels
to take the two vacant seats. Monsieur Verney,
like a good, obedient husband, could not hold out
long against his wife; and when the Ravenels
passed, not dreaming that any one in Bienville
would share a table with them, Monsieur Verney
rose, and said politely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are looking for a place, Monsieur, there
are two chairs vacant here&mdash;we shall be most happy
if you will occupy them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ravenel stopped, amazed, and the color poured
into Sophie Ravenel&rsquo;s beautiful, pale face, and in
an instant more they were seated with the Verneys,
the first social recognition they had had since that
day when Delorme&rsquo;s blow drove Sophie into Rav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>enel&rsquo;s
arms. After thanking Monsieur and Madame
Verney, the Ravenels gave their modest order, and
then, according to the polite manner of the French,
they began to talk together.</p>

<p>Captain Ravenel at once recognized Paul, and
made the boy&rsquo;s heart leap with delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this young gentleman I recollect well, as
having been most polite and attentive to Madame
Ravenel once, when she fell ill in the park.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Verneys had known nothing of Paul&rsquo;s share
in that scene, and did not identify him at all with
that memorable occasion which was known all over
Bienville, when Sophie Ravenel had been so cruelly
insulted. So Monsieur and Madame Verney
beamed with delight while Captain Ravenel gravely
thanked Paul.</p>

<p>The boy gazed at Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s refined and
melancholy beauty, and felt a renewal of the charm
which she exercised over all sensitive natures. Then
his heart began to beat furiously as his mother
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have often admired, Madame, the little girl
that I have seen with you in the park&mdash;your sister,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Sophie, &ldquo;my little half-sister, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>whom I had the charge during all her babyhood,
and who is like a child to both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is very, very pretty,&rdquo; said Madame Verney,
hoping that embodied prettiness would one day
belong to her Paul, together with all that went
with it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And very good-hearted,&rdquo; replied Sophie, smiling.
&ldquo;She is not a French child&mdash;my stepmother
was American, and Lucie is like her, unconventional
and even wilful, but good and tender-hearted beyond
any creature that I have ever known. She
lives with our grandmother, and grandmothers, you
know, are not very severe mentors, so I am afraid
my little sister does not get as good discipline as
she would have had if her mother had lived; and
when she comes to visit us, Captain Ravenel spoils
her so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sophie stopped, turning her full, soft gaze on
Captain Ravenel. She thought him the best, the
noblest of men, and did not love him the less because
he was so indulgent to Lucie.</p>

<p>Monsieur Verney, putting his hand on Paul&rsquo;s
shoulder, told Captain Ravenel that there was the
future Murat of the French army. Paul&rsquo;s father
was always joking him, but the boy did not mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>it in the least, and laughed at the notion of being
a great cavalry officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are going into the cavalry, eh?&rdquo; asked
Captain Ravenel. &ldquo;Why not the artillery?&rdquo; Ravenel
himself had been an artillery officer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because I am not clever enough, I am afraid,&rdquo;
replied Paul frankly; &ldquo;an officer has to be very
clever to be in the artillery&mdash;clever at his books, I
mean, and I am not very clever at my books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do not complain,&rdquo; said Monsieur Verney,
in response to this speech, &ldquo;he does very well at his
books, but he has always wished to be in the cavalry,
so I presume that is where he will land eventually.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a little while the Ravenels rose&mdash;they were
not persons who outstayed their welcome&mdash;and went
away with gratitude in their hearts to the Verneys.
This was a little thing, but it was the entering
wedge of something like social recognition in Bienville.
The next time they met on the terrace, it
was Monsieur Verney, who, with Madame, asked
permission to sit at the table with the Ravenels.
Captain Ravenel, in the course of the conversation,
mentioned some pictures he had of the Arab tribesmen
in Algeria. Monsieur Verney spoke of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>to Paul next day, and the boy begged that he
might ask Captain Ravenel to show him the pictures.
Monsieur Verney consented, and that afternoon
Paul, finding the Ravenels taking their accustomed
walk, went up, and, according to his
habit, blushing very much, said that his father
had given him permission to ask Captain
Ravenel to show him his Arab pictures. Captain
Ravenel promptly appointed the next morning,
after breakfast, and Paul presented himself at half
after eleven. He was the first visitor of their own
class who had darkened the door of the Ravenels
since they came to Bienville.</p>

<p>Captain Ravenel not only showed him the pictures,
but talked to him so interestingly that the
boy went home captivated. Moreover, he told his
father that some things, which seemed so hard for
him to learn at school, Captain Ravenel had made
quite clear to him, and it came to Monsieur Verney&rsquo;s
mind that it would be a good thing to get
Captain Ravenel to coach Paul an hour or two
every day during his holidays. Madame Verney
rapturously approved of this. The vision of Lucie
hovered over it all. The arrangement was soon
made, and, during the rest of his holidays, for two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>hours every day, Paul sat with Captain Ravenel,
in the garden on pleasant days, but in the salon
when it was disagreeable, and studied mathematics
and geography with him.</p>

<p>Never was there so attentive a boy, and the Verneys
were charmed and delighted at the progress
Paul made in his studies. He was naturally of a
determined and plodding nature, and Ravenel was a
good instructor, but there was another motive urging
Paul on. Ravenel was Lucie&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
and when that glorious day came, when Lucie would
be a young lady, living in Bienville, and Paul
would be a young lieutenant of cavalry, calling her
in public Mademoiselle Bernard, and in secret
Lucie, it would be a very good thing for him to be
in favor with Captain Ravenel, and also with Madame
Ravenel. Paul&rsquo;s politeness and courtesy, the
promptness with which his cap came off his reddish
hair when he saw Madame Ravenel, the way
in which he flew to open the door or the gate for
her, the gentleness of his behavior, made Sophie his
friend as much as Captain Ravenel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2></div>

<p>In spite of his two hours&rsquo; work every day with
Captain Ravenel, Paul found plenty of opportunity
still to be with Toni. They maintained their
attitude of confidence toward each other as regarded
their different lady-loves, and about this
time Toni confessed to Paul that strange and thorough
revolution that had taken place in his nature,
by which he had, for the first time in his life,
given to another person something which he might
have gobbled up himself, in giving Denise nearly
all of his two sticks of candy. Paul commended
this highly in Toni, and said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Boys should always give girls the preference
in things like that. My father always gives my
mother all the chicken livers&mdash;that is the way with
gentlemen. But, Toni,&rdquo; added Paul frankly and
seriously, &ldquo;I am afraid you are not a gentleman,
and never will be one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; answered Toni, &ldquo;I am no gentleman&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t want to be a gentleman&mdash;I am only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>Toni. But I like Denise almost as much as you do
Mademoiselle Lucie. At first, I meant to marry
Denise just because her aunt keeps a pastry shop,
but now&rdquo;&mdash;here Toni expanded his chest, and
looked hard at Paul&mdash;&ldquo;but now, I believe, that is, I
almost believe, I could marry Denise even if her
aunt didn&rsquo;t keep a pastry shop. You see, Denise
is so very clean, and I like clean little girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni, at that moment, had gathered on his
person all the dirt possible, in spite of the earnest
efforts of Madame Marcel in a contrary direction.
His hands were grimy, there was a smudge on his
nose, and his blue overalls, which had been clean
that very morning, were all mud and tatters. A
more disreputable-looking boy than Toni did not
exist in Bienville. Paul, realizing the incongruity
between Toni&rsquo;s sentiments and his appearance,
burst out laughing, but Toni did not mind being
laughed at, and grinned himself in sympathy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I am dirty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t mind&mdash;I
am no gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s holidays were to end in September, and the
Verneys, out of good-will to Captain Ravenel,
and after much serious cogitation, invited Captain
and Madame Ravenel to drink tea with them one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>afternoon in their garden. It was a small thing,
apparently, this drinking tea with the advocate
and his wife, who were neither rich nor important
people in Bienville, but it meant the rehabilitation
of the Ravenels. In these years of seclusion, both
of them had grown timid, and Sophie rather shrank
from appearing once more in that world in which
she had shone so beautifully; but Ravenel, through
the point of view of a man of sense, desired Sophie
to go, and his will was law with her.</p>

<p>So, on the afternoon before Paul left, the Ravenels
went over, and in the little arbor in the Verneys&rsquo;
garden had tea together. Paul made one of
the party, and also Toni, unseen by anybody except
Paul. There was a hole in the hedge, which
was close to the summer-house, and outside that
hole Toni crouched. At one or two points in the
banquet, which consisted of cakes and fruit as well
as tea, Paul made excuses to pass the hedge, and
every time he handed through the hole a cake or
some fruit to Toni, and, what was the strangest
thing in the world, Toni ate the cakes himself and
put the fruit into a paper bag which he had
brought for the purpose. The third and last time,
when Paul surreptitiously handed a couple of figs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>through the hole, Toni held up the bag and whispered,
&ldquo;For Denise.&rdquo; Paul nearly dropped with
astonishment.</p>

<p>But this was not the only surprise of the afternoon.
The summer-house was near the open iron
gate of the garden, and as the grown people were
sitting, quietly chatting and drinking their tea,
Colonel Duquesne passed by, and, stopping in
front of the gate, tried to light his cigar, but used
up the last match in his match-box without being
able to do it. Then Monsieur Verney, who was the
soul of good-will and hospitality, taking from the
table some of the matches Madame Verney used for
her tea-kettle, walked to the gate and offered them
to Colonel Duquesne. There was a breeze stirring,
enough to make it difficult to light a cigar out of
doors, and Monsieur Verney invited Colonel Duquesne
to come into the summer-house. The colonel,
looking in and seeing Madame Verney smiling
and bowing, and the Ravenels sitting there, accepted
Monsieur Verney&rsquo;s invitation and went in.
Walking up, he spoke gallantly to Madame Verney,
and to Captain and Madame Ravenel, quite
as if he knew nothing about that past which had
wrecked their lives. He did more: when Madame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Verney pressed him to accept a cup of tea, he sat
down at the tea-table, and made himself most agreeable,
addressing Captain Ravenel without effusion,
but quite as an old comrade in arms.</p>

<p>Such a thing neither of the Ravenels had ever
hoped or looked for, and the Verneys, who were the
best-hearted people in the world, were delighted
at the success of their invitation.</p>

<p>Colonel Duquesne sat for half an hour and, at
last lighting his cigar, he departed. As he went
down the street, he shook his gray head and said
to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I had a wife or a daughter, what a wigging
I should get when I go home!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Had their last interview in the little cranny on the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">The next day, Paul was to go back to school, and
early in the morning he and Toni had their last
interview in the little cranny on the bridge. It was
a beautiful, bright September morning, but both
boys were rather low in spirits. No boy that ever
lived, not even so excellent a one as Paul Verney,
goes back to school with a light heart. But Paul
made the best of it. Toni was depressed at the
thought of being reduced again to the society of
Hermann as the only person who could understand
and reply to his talk; for although Jacques and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>horses were equally as intelligent as Hermann, they
were not so responsive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Toni,&rdquo; Paul urged, &ldquo;pray try and
learn to play the violin or do something to make a
living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni shook his head dolefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like making a living, and besides, if I
marry Denise, what&rsquo;s the use? Denise will take
care of me&mdash;I know she will. She and my mother
will make a living for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul felt perfectly hopeless at this speech of
Toni&rsquo;s&mdash;there was no doing anything with him.
Paul returned to school and Toni went back to his
music lessons, but with no better success than before.
He was now quite twelve years old, and he
had become a public scandal in the town of Bienville.
Even old Marie, who sat by the monument,
scolded him for his idleness. At last, Madame Marcel,
actuated by the press of public opinion, was
forced to put Toni to work. As a great favor,
Clery, the tailor, took Toni on trial, with a view
to making him a professor of the sartorial art.
Clery&rsquo;s two sons, aged twelve and fourteen, could
already make, each, a respectable pair of trousers,
and Madame Marcel, tearfully laying aside her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>ambitions, implored Clery to make Toni a replica
of the Clery boys.</p>

<p>Toni was frightened half to death at the prospect
of going into a tailor&rsquo;s shop, and his mother
had literally to drag him there on the morning
when he was to be inducted into his new profession.
The shop was a small room, where two or three sewing-machines
were perpetually going. There sat
Clery and his two boys at work.</p>

<p>For the first week or two, Toni was employed in
carrying parcels, which he found onerous enough.
He had a way, however, of taking an hour to
do an errand which ought only to have taken him
ten minutes, and when during that first week in
the tailor&rsquo;s shop he was intrusted with a pair of
Captain Ravenel&rsquo;s well-worn trousers which had
been pressed and cleaned, and it took him fifty-seven
minutes to carry them from Clery&rsquo;s shop to
the Ravenels&rsquo; door, which was exactly four minutes
away, Clery said that would never do.</p>

<p>As for Toni, these long absences from the shop
meant getting back to his old haunts, and to the
things he was not afraid of&mdash;the bridge by the
river, and the sight of a cavalry troop going out
for exercise, or a conversation with Jacques by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>way of encouragement. He had a feeling of terror
when he sat in the shop with the tailor&rsquo;s eye fixed
on him, and the two boys, industriously sewing
away on the sewing-machine, and eying him with
contempt. He sat there, this wild and reckless
Toni, who was thought to fear neither God, nor
man, nor beast, the most frightened little boy imaginable.
He could not have told, to save his life,
what he was afraid of, but he knew that he was
afraid&mdash;so much so that he stayed with Clery a
whole year. In that time he learned absolutely
nothing except to carry parcels, which he knew
before.</p>

<p>If it had not been for the regard that Clery had
for Madame Marcel, he would not have kept Toni
a fortnight. As it was, he found it impossible to
teach Toni the smallest thing about the tailoring
trade. He could not operate a sewing-machine to
save his life, nor learn to sew a stitch or to handle
a smoothing-iron. Clery, who knew what a problem
it was, thought long and anxiously over this
problem of Madame Marcel&rsquo;s. All through the
winter days, he kept his eye on Toni, hoping that
the boy might learn something; but when the leaves
came in the spring, Toni knew no more about tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>oring
than he did when the autumn winds swept the
trees bare.</p>

<p>It was then May, and Toni was finding the confinement
of the shop almost more than his soul could
bear. It seemed to him impossible that such a life
should continue, away from the fresh air, away
from the damp, sweet-smelling earth, away from
horses and troopers. He could not even see Denise,
for Clery had taught him one thing, and that was
not to loiter by the wayside, and sometimes a whole
week would pass without his having a word with the
lady of his love.</p>

<p>And Denise, with the clairvoyance of childhood,
saw, in the troubled depths of Toni&rsquo;s black eyes,
that he was soul-sick, and in her tender heart she
felt sorry for him. Sometimes she would lie in
wait for Toni under the branches of the acacia
tree, and hand him out a tart or a piece of ginger
bread, but even this had no taste in Toni&rsquo;s mouth&mdash;life
was so dark and drear to him. How he longed
for those happy days when he scraped and talked
in Hermann&rsquo;s garret, or those still better days,
when there was no thought of work, and he could
spend the whole day, if he liked, lying on his stomach
on the parapet of the bridge and watch the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>silvery backs of the fishes as they tumbled about in
the rippling water! It seemed to him as if Denise
was the only soul in the world who understood and
pitied him. Even his mother, who he had hoped
would let him live in idleness all his days, had done
this strange and cruel thing of trying to make him
work. Paul Verney wished him to work, Clery
made him work, the Clery boys openly despised
him for not working. Only Denise, of everybody
in the wide world, knew what Toni himself knew&mdash;that
he was never meant to work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2></div>

<p>Toni was now thirteen years old, and though
short, was very lithe and well made. He had never
been on a horse&rsquo;s back since that glorious day when
the old cavalry charger had run off with him, and
he had not been able to enjoy the society of the
horses much, or to lurk around the riding-school
since his apprenticeship to Clery. On a certain
May day which, although Toni did not know it,
was a day of fate to him, he saw the greatest sight
of his life&mdash;the debarkation of a circus company,
with all its horses and other animals, at the little
station in Bienville.</p>

<p>Toni had often seen recruits debark when they
came to the cavalry school for instruction. Clumsy,
awkward fellows they were&mdash;at first ridiculously
uneasy on a horse, and often as much afraid of a
horse as Toni was of people. And he had seen
them return, fine, dashing-looking troopers, after
having been licked into shape in the riding-school.
He loved to see the horses led to the train&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>were so intelligent, so orderly, and seemed like real
comrades of the troopers. But he had never seen
anything like the trained intelligence of the circus
horses in his life, and on this May day, when he
wandered down to the station and saw horses who
obeyed the word of command, like human beings, in
getting off the train and taking up their right
places, he was astounded and delighted. Every
boy in Bienville was at the station to see the circus
arrive, but Toni, according to his habit, slunk off
by himself. There were numerous cages of animals,
in which the other boys took a much greater interest
than in the horses, but the other animals were
nothing to Toni, to whom the cult of the horse was
everything.</p>

<p>He followed the circus people, at a respectful
distance, to the large open field where they put up
the tent, but the chief point of interest to him was
the temporary canvas stables which were erected.
He knew that it was time for him to go back to
Clery&rsquo;s, but he could not, to save his life, have torn
himself away from the fascinating sights and
sounds which surrounded him.</p>

<p>Everywhere was the bustle and well-regulated
haste of such companies. The circus, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>really a small affair, had arrived in the morning,
and the tent was up, and the performance ready to
open by two o&rsquo;clock. Toni spent the whole of the
intervening time watching what was going on.
Clery and the shop quite faded from his memory.
He saw the circus riders come out of the dressing-tent,
in their beautiful costumes of red and gold and
pink and silver, a little tarnished, but glorious in
Toni&rsquo;s eyes, and he saw the horses gaily caparisoned
and almost adored them.</p>

<p>If he had a single franc, he would be able to
go into the tent, and see the performance, but he
had not a franc, nor did he know where to get one,
except&mdash;except&mdash;he knew where his mother kept
a tin box full of francs. He was afraid to go to
her and ask her for the franc, because he had not
been near Clery&rsquo;s shop that day, and if his mother
once caught him she might send him back to the
shop, and that would mean no circus for him that
day. But it was so easy to open the box and take
out a franc&mdash;a thing he had never done before or
thought of doing. But, like Captain Ravenel and
Sophie, there are moments in the lives of human
beings when temptation overwhelms the soul. Toni,
who was neither a thief nor a liar, became both, just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>as Captain Ravenel and Sophie Delorme had, in one
desperate moment, trampled on the social law.</p>

<p>So Toni to, whom, in spite of his faults, deceit
was as foreign even as it was to Paul Verney, conceived
the thought of taking a franc out of his
mother&rsquo;s tin box. He sneaked back home, along
by-lanes and garden walls, and crept in through the
little back door which opened into the kitchen. His
mother was in the front shop, and did not see him.
As he stole softly up the narrow stair into the bedroom
above, the sun was shining brightly, and the
clock on the mantel pointed to half-past one. Toni
always remembered this as an hour of fate.</p>

<p>The circus performance was to begin at two, and
he barely had time to find the key which his mother
kept under the bureau cover, and to unlock the
press in which she kept her strong box, to find the
key to the strong box hanging up on a nail inside
the press, to open it and there, in a smaller tin box,
to find many pieces of silver. Toni took out a
single franc. He might have taken the whole box,
but he never thought of it. It was not money he
wanted, but a sight of the circus. He then closed
and replaced the box, made everything as it was
before, and, creeping down stairs, rushed off to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>field where the circus tent was up, his heart beating
with a wild excitement which was not joy&mdash;neither
was it pain.</p>

<p>The performance was almost ready to begin
when Toni handed in his franc with a trembling
hand. The place was full; everybody in Bienville
seemed to be there, and many persons from the surrounding
country, but Toni managed to slip himself
between two stout peasant women with baskets
in their laps, and contrived to see the whole performance
without being seen. He gave himself up,
à la Toni, to the enjoyment of the moment, putting
off until four o&rsquo;clock the hated interview with his
mother and the still worse one that he must have
with Clery.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo5"><img src="images/i_124.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;Toni took out a single franc.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Toni took out a single franc.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">But the circus to him was a sight well worth a
dozen whippings. The view of the prancing horses,
so wonderfully intelligent, the beautiful young ladies
in gauze and spangles, the riders in their satin
suits,&mdash;all were a dream to Toni. He did not see
any of the grease spots on the costumes, nor the
paint on the faces of the lovely young ladies; all
was a foretaste of Paradise. It came to him in a
moment what his real destiny was&mdash;to be a circus
rider. At once his imagination seized upon it. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>wondered himself that he had managed to exist
so long without the circus. All that vaulting and
jumping and leaping, that careering around on
the backs of brave horses, must be heavenly&mdash;it
could not possibly be work.</p>

<p>Toni saw himself, in imagination, one of those
glorious beings. Two things only did not fit into
this picture which he drew of his future&mdash;his
mother and little Denise. He could not imagine
either of them in the place of those short-skirted,
fluffy-haired young ladies, with pink silk stockings
and very stout legs.</p>

<p>Just before the end a pony was brought out
which succeeded in throwing three clowns so successfully
that the audience was in roars of laughter.
The ring-master challenged any one present below
a certain weight to come out in the ring and try to
ride this astonishing pony. Toni, without his own
volition, and knowing no more of what he was doing
than a sleep-walker, wriggled out from between the
two fat peasant women and got down in the sanded
ring. There was a roaring in his ears and a blur
before his eyes, and he could not have told how it
was that he found himself upon the back of the
kicking, plunging pony careering around that daz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>zling
circle. All Toni knew was that he was the
pony&rsquo;s master. There was no shaking him off.</p>

<p>Shouts and cheers resounded, each increasing as
the pony, still making desperate efforts to get rid
of Toni, sped around the ring. But Toni held on
as firmly and easily as if he had been born and bred
in a riding-school. He had not the slightest sensation
of fear, any more than on that day so long
ago when the old cavalry horse had run away with
him. The cheers and cries increased as the pony,
realizing that Toni had the upper hand of him,
came down to a steady gallop.</p>

<p>The ring-master advanced and cracked his whip
a little, and Toni fully expected the pony to start
anew the wild antics of the beginning. Instead of
that, the pony came to a dead halt which was expected
to throw Toni to the ground, but did not.
He looked up, however, and caught sight of the
ring-master standing close to him. He was a fierce-looking
man with black eyes like Toni&rsquo;s. The
sight of those eyes waked all the cowardice in Toni&rsquo;s
nature. He thought he should have died of fright
while that man was looking at him, and then it
came over him that hundreds of eyes were looking
at him all the time. He slipped off the pony&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>back and like a hunted creature dashed toward the
nearest opening of the tent and fled&mdash;fled homeward.
He meant to creep up stairs and crawl under
his little bed and stay there until his mother
came up stairs, when he would catch her around
the neck and tell her all about the franc and ask
her, yes, actually ask her to give him a whipping
just to restore things to their normal balance. He
felt that he deserved five hundred whippings.</p>

<p>As he raced homeward, he passed Clery&rsquo;s shop
without looking that way. Suddenly Clery himself
darted out and seizing him dragged him
through the shop and into a little back room quite
dark. Clery, who was an honest fellow, meant to do
Toni the greatest service of his life, and said, holding
him by the collar:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni, you are a thief!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni, in whose mind the paradise of circus land
and the paroxysm of terror were rioting confusedly,
looked dreamily at Clery, who looked back sternly
at him. Toni remaining silent, Clery shook him,
and hissed into his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a thief! You stole the money from
your mother to go to the circus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni still said nothing, and Clery continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When you did not come back, I knew that you
had gone to the circus. I went over and spoke to
your mother, and she told me she was sure you had
not gone because you had no money. Then I saw
you come back here, and go out again, and run
away as fast as you could. I went over and told
your mother that you had been in the house, but she
declared that you had not. My boy Jean says he
saw you running toward the house with both hands
open and likewise your mouth, and come out of it
holding a franc between your teeth. So Toni, you
are a thief, and your mother, I am sure, will never
love you again, and to keep you from being sent
to prison for life, I mean to give you as good a
whipping as I am able, for fear your mother will
not do her duty by you, and when I am through,
I will take you over to her, and when I tell the
police&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clery paused. Toni was thoroughly awake and
alive then. A thief! Tell the police! That meant
prison to him. This awful vision drove everything
else out of his mind. And then Clery, suddenly
brandishing the cane, brought it down on Toni&rsquo;s
shoulders with all the strength of an able-bodied
tailor. Toni uttered a half-shriek, but after that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>neither cried out nor wept, but bore stoically the
blows that Clery rained upon him. It seemed as if
the day of judgment had come.</p>

<p>When Clery, honest man, had finished with Toni
and was taking him across the street, Toni looked
around him with wild eyes of despair. That precious
refuge under his little bed seemed no longer
open to him. He was a thief&mdash;he must go to prison&mdash;that
was all he knew. And just then he looked
up and there was a policeman walking straight toward
him. That was enough! Toni, wresting
himself from Clery&rsquo;s grasp, turned and ran like one
possessed, the specter of a mad fear chasing him,
down toward the bridge. He was afraid to crawl
into his usual nook, because he could be easily seen
from there, so he ran across the bridge and hid
himself in a thicket of young chestnut trees on the
other side.</p>

<p>He lay, terror stricken, his heart beating so that
he thought it must almost make a hole in the
ground. What was to become of him? His mother,
as Clery had told him, could love him no longer.
He dared not look any one in the face, but felt
an outcast, like Cain. He lay there for hours,
through the waning afternoon, until the purple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>shadows descended on the white town, on the sparkling
river, the long rows of barracks and the open
fields in which the circus tent had been pitched. It
was now taken down and the circus people were preparing
to go by the highway to the next town, ten
miles away.</p>

<p>It was nearly eight o&rsquo;clock and the young moon
was trembling in the heavens, when the circus cavalcade
began to travel along the white and dusty
highroad, passing by Toni&rsquo;s place of concealment.
It suddenly came into his mind that the only thing
for him to do was to go with the circus. As the end
of the procession of carts and vans and horsemen
and horsewomen passed, Toni crept out of his hiding-place
and came up to a company of men who
were trudging along on foot. He said to one of
them, Nicolas by name, a youngish man with hair
and beard as red as Judas&rsquo;:</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I walk a little way with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This little way, in Toni&rsquo;s mind, meant to walk
through life with the circus company.</p>

<p>Nicolas laughed; runaway boys were the general
concomitants of a circus company. And in a moment
more he recognized the boy who had stuck on
the pony&rsquo;s back, and then had run away so quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, come along, you young rascal,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and you can carry this portmanteau if you like,&rdquo;&mdash;and
he slung the heavy portmanteau from his
own shoulders to Toni&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Toni trudged along, carrying the portmanteau
easily, being a strong boy. He got into a conversation
with his new friend and soon expressed his
determination to stay with the circus, if only they
would give him something to eat, for he was very
hungry. A woman, walking along with them,
heard this and handed Toni a couple of biscuits,
which he eagerly devoured. They trudged on for
two hours, the moon growing larger and brighter
and flooding with a white radiance the hedges, the
wide fields, the woods and the highway along which
the cavalcade traveled slowly. Toni felt an immense
sense of relief. The police could not come
so far to get him. He hardened his heart against
his mother. He judged, from what Clery had told
him, that his mother would be the first to denounce
him.</p>

<p>And so began poor Toni&rsquo;s life with the circus,
away from his mother, away from Denise, away
from Paul Verney&mdash;only Jacques remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2></div>

<p>Seven years afterward, Toni found himself one
day at the little town of Beaupr&eacute;, in the valley of
the Seine, where the circus was performing, for
Toni had remained with it all that time. Beautiful
young ladies in spangles had come and gone, demigods
in red satin with white sashes had done the
same. Toni himself was a demigod in red satin
and a white sash, and was the crack rider of the
circus. He had a large head-line of letters a foot
high all to himself&mdash;Monsieur Louis D&rsquo;Argens he
was called on the bill-boards, although everybody
about the circus called him Toni. Toni was then
twenty years old and at least twenty years wiser
than he had been seven years before. One does not
spend seven years in the circus without learning
many things. He learned all the immense wickednesses
as well as the immense virtues which may be
found in the lower half of humanity.</p>

<p>But, like most demigods, Toni was not happy.
Perhaps it was a part of the general quarrel which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>every human being has with fate. But Toni&rsquo;s
principal quarrel was that he was haunted with
fears of all sorts. This madcap fellow, this daring
bareback rider, this centaur of a man, to whom
nothing in the shape of horseflesh could cause the
slightest tremor, who could ride four horses at
once and could do a great many other things requiring
vast physical courage, coolness and resolution,
was, morally, as great a coward as he had
been in the old days when he ran away from all
the boys in Bienville except Paul Verney, and
ran away from home rather than face his mother
after having taken a single franc. He was mortally
afraid of a number of persons: of Clery, the
tailor in far-off Bienville, for fear he might set the
police on him; of Nicolas, who had the upper hand
of him completely, and of a friend of Nicolas&rsquo;,
Pierre by name, who was the most complete scoundrel
unhung except Nicolas himself. Both of these
two men Toni could have whipped with one hand
tied behind his back, for he was unusually muscular
and, though somewhat short, a perfect athlete.
His two scampish friends, Nicolas and Pierre,
were wretched objects physically, such as men become
who are born and bred in the slums, who have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>behind them a half-starved ancestry going back
five hundred years, and who are on intimate terms
with the devil. For a circus rider may practise
every one of the seven deadly sins with perfect impunity
except one, that of drunkenness. A circus
rider must be sober.</p>

<p>They had drawn Toni into many a scrape, but
here again Toni&rsquo;s strange cowardice had saved him
from taking an actual part in any wrong-doing.
He watched out for Nicolas and Pierre, at their
bidding, he knew of their wrong-doing, where they
kept their stolen gains, how they cheated the manager,
how they abused the women. But Toni himself,
although the associate of two such rogues and
rascals, and in many ways their blind tool, had
kept himself perfectly free from the commission
of any crime or misdemeanor. His heart remained
good&mdash;poor Toni!</p>

<p>He still hankered, mother-sick, for Madame Marcel.
Once every year since he had run away he had
written to her as well as he could, for Toni&rsquo;s literary
accomplishments were very meager, a letter all
tear-stained, telling her he was well and trying to
behave himself, and he hoped she did not have rheumatism
in her knees and that he was sorry for hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>ing
stolen the franc. He even sent her a little money
once a year, which Madame Marcel did not need,
but which Toni did, and in these letters he always
sent his love to Denise, but he never gave his address
nor any clue to his employment. He was
afraid to give any address for her to answer his
letter, and so did not really know whether his
mother were alive or dead.</p>

<p>His heart still yearned unceasingly after Paul
Verney, the friend of his boyhood; and none of the
young ladies in tights and spangles had been
able to put out of his mind little Denise in her blue-checked
apron, and her plait of yellow hair hanging
down her back, and her downcast eyes and
sweet way of speaking his name. He never heard
the church-bells ringing on a Sunday morning that
his Bienville Sundays did not come back to him&mdash;his
mother washing and dressing him for church;
the sight of Denise, in her short white frock, trotting
along solemnly with her hand in Mademoiselle
Duval&rsquo;s; Paul Verney smartly dressed and hanging
on to his father&rsquo;s arm; Madame Ravenel, in her
black gown, standing just inside the church door,
with Captain Ravenel, grave and stern-looking,
standing outside&mdash;and then the world in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>Toni lived seemed like a dream, and this dream of
Bienville the only solid reality.</p>

<p>One friend remained to him, the ever-faithful
Jacques, now battered almost beyond the semblance
of a soldier. Toni continued his friendship for
horses. Half of his success with them came from
the perfect understanding of a horse&rsquo;s heart and
soul which Toni possessed. The other half came
from that strange and total absence of fear where
actual danger was concerned. When the circus
tent caught fire in the midst of a crowded performance,
Toni was the calmest and most self-possessed
person there, and careered around the ring doing
his specialty, a wonderful vaulting and tumbling
act, while the canvas roof overhead was blazing
and no one but himself saw it. When the bridge
broke through, with the circus train upon it, Toni
was the first man to pull off his clothes and jump
into the water, and assisted in saving half a dozen
lives. He was regarded somewhat as a hero and
daredevil, while secretly he knew himself to be the
greatest coward on the face of the earth. Nicolas
and Pierre knew this weakness of Toni&rsquo;s from the
beginning and traded on it most successfully.</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Doing his specialty, a wonderful vaulting and tumbling act.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">The company was performing in the fields out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>side
of Beaupr&eacute;, but as they were playing a whole
week&rsquo;s engagement in the town, some of them were
quartered in the little hamlet close by. Within
sight of the hamlet&rsquo;s church-spire was a beautiful
ch&acirc;teau standing all white and glistening in the
sunlight, surrounded by prim and beautiful gardens
watched over by sylvan deities in marble. On
the broad terrace a fountain plashed, and lower
down a beautifully-wooded park stretched out.
Over the stone gateway leading into the park were
the words &ldquo;Ch&acirc;teau Bernard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first time Toni saw this was when he was on
his way to the midday performance in the town of
Beaupr&eacute;. He stopped, and the meaning of that
name flashed into his mind in a second. Little
Lucie, that charming little fairy whom Paul Verney
loved so much, and of whom he had confided,
blushingly and stumblingly, some things to Toni in
those far-off days at Bienville, seven years before,
when he and Paul had sat cuddled together on the
abutment of the bridge,&mdash;the sight of the name
&ldquo;Ch&acirc;teau Bernard&rdquo; brought all this back to Toni.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful, bright spring morning, like
those mornings at Bienville, except that to Toni
the sun never shone so brightly anywhere as it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>shone at Bienville. He stopped and gazed long at
the ch&acirc;teau, his black eyes as soft and sparkling
as ever they had been, although now he was a man
grown. But there was an eternal boyishness about
him of which he could no more get rid than he could
cease to be Toni. There had not been a day in all
the years since he left Bienville that he had not
thought of Paul Verney, and thinking of Paul
would naturally bring to his mind the beautiful little
Lucie who was like a dream maiden to him&mdash;not
at all like Denise, who was to him a substantial
though charming creature. He reckoned that Lucie
must be now twenty, and Paul must be a sublieutenant.</p>

<p>As Toni stood there, his arms crossed, and
leaning on the stone wall, he heard the clatter of
horses&rsquo; hoofs, and down the avenue came three
riders, a young girl and her escort in front and a
groom behind. As they dashed past Toni, he recognized,
in the slight, willowy figure in the close-fitting
black habit and coquettish hat, Lucie Bernard,
a young lady now, but the same beautiful,
joyous sprite she had been ten years before in the
park at Bienville. The cavalier riding with her
was, like Toni, below middle size, but, unlike Toni,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>light-haired and blue-eyed, not handsome, but better
than handsome&mdash;manly, intelligent, clear of eye,
firm of seat, full of life and energy, and with an
unstained youth. It was&mdash;it was&mdash;Paul Verney.</p>

<p>As the two flashed past, followed by the groom,
Toni almost cried aloud in his agony of joy and
pain, but he dared not run after them and call to
them. They, of course, knew that he had run
away from Bienville because he was a thief. That
theft of a franc was perpetually gnawing at Toni&rsquo;s
heart. The sight of Paul Verney seemed to show
him the gulf between them. Toni stood, leaning on
the wall, his head hanging down, his mind and soul
in a tumult, for a long time, until presently the
sound of a clock striking through the open window
of the keeper&rsquo;s house aroused him to the knowledge
that it was almost time for the circus to begin.
He ran nearly all the way to Beaupr&eacute;, for he
worked as honestly at his trade of a circus rider&mdash;only
it did not seem like work to Toni&mdash;as Paul
Verney did at his as a sublieutenant of cavalry.</p>

<p>But all that day, through the performance, during
the intermission, and at the afternoon performance
and in the evening, when Toni went back to
his little lodging in the village, the vision haunted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>him. Lucie and Paul looked so young, so happy,
so fresh, so innocent! They had not behind them
anything terrifying. Neither one of them had
ever stolen anything, unless it was the other&rsquo;s
heart. They had no Nicolas and Pierre to make
them stand watch while thefts were being committed&mdash;to
make them lie in order to shield rascally
proceedings&mdash;always to be threatening them with
exposure.</p>

<p>Toni was so tormented by these thoughts that
he lay on his hard little bed in his garret lodging,
wide-awake, until midnight and then he was roused
from his first light sleep by a pebble thrown at his
window. Toni waked, started up in his bed and
shuddered. That was the sign that Nicolas and
Pierre wanted him. They were his masters; he
knew it and they knew it. He got up obediently,
however, slipped on his clothes, and went down the
narrow stair noiselessly. Outside were his two
friends.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Nicolas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; weakly asked Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will tell you when we get there,&rdquo; replied
Pierre, with a grin.</p>

<p>There was no moon, and the night was warm and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>sultry, although it was only May. Toni followed his
two friends along the highroad. Nicolas and Pierre
spoke to each other in low voices, and Toni easily
made out that they were engaged on a scheme
of robbery. At that his soul turned sick with horror.
He had never robbed anybody of a single
centime except that one solitary franc which he had
taken from his mother, but he knew more about
robberies than most people. The bare thought of
them always frightened him inexpressibly, but he
continued trudging along without making any protest.</p>

<p>Presently they came to the stone wall around the
park of the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard, over which they all
scrambled and made straight for the ch&acirc;teau. Everything
was quiet about it and apparently every
one was asleep, except in one room on the ground
floor. There were some gigantic, luxuriant lilac
bushes, now in all their glory of bloom and perfume,
and under these the three crept. Never again
could Toni smell the lilac blooms without being
overcome by a sickening recollection. The window
was open, and within the small and luxuriously-furnished
room they could see an old lady, very
splendidly dressed, and a man of middle age. Toni
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>at once recognized her from the description which
Paul and Lucie had given him so many years before.
Madame Bernard was very large, tall and
handsome, and sterner in aspect than both old
Marie, who sat by the monument at Bienville, and
the monument itself. She was by far the grandest-looking
person Toni had ever seen, and he did not
suspect that she was as great a coward in her way
as he was in his. Courage is a very variable quantity
and subject to mysterious ebbs and tides.</p>

<p>Some gold and bank-notes were on a table before
them, and the old lady was saying, weeping a little
as she spoke:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you have behaved to me most cruelly,
Count Delorme. Whatever Sophie&rsquo;s faults were,
you got, at least, the benefit of her entire fortune,
which you squandered in your five years of marriage.
Now you come here, when my little Lucie is
at an age to be damaged by raking up this old
story about Sophie, although you promised me, if
I would give you two thousand francs a year, that
you would never show yourself in this part of the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am obliged to show myself,&rdquo; responded Delorme,
a thin-lipped, hawk-eyed man, who looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>the villain he was. &ldquo;What are two thousand francs
a year? My cigars cost me almost as much as that.
And as for Sophie&rsquo;s fortune&mdash;well, a woman like
that was dear at any price. If I had not got it,
Ravenel would, and I should not think that you
would be particularly proud of him as a grandson-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not,&rdquo; responded old Madame Bernard
weakly, and then summoning something of dignity,
added, &ldquo;but I venture to say that he is a better
man than you are, Count Delorme. At least, he
has been far more considerate of the feelings of
Sophie&rsquo;s family, and has kept himself and her in
the strictest seclusion, nor have they asked me
for a franc. I think, also, that the Ravenels still
have many friends, while I am not aware of a single
one that you have, Count Delorme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In answer to this, Delorme coolly picked up the
notes and money, and, without counting either,
stuffed them in his pocket. Madame Bernard made
a faint protest. &ldquo;There is much more there,&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;than two thousand francs. I did not mean
to give you all.&rdquo; But Delorme, rising and taking
his hat, walked out of the room, and let himself out
of the house by a small side door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Toni knew then what his friends were up to.
The three followed Delorme through the park,
Toni lagging behind. Presently, in a dark place
overhung by a clump of cedars, they came upon
Delorme, who had every vice except that of cowardice.
He turned on them and said, in a threatening
voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by following me, fellows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Pierre and Nicolas fell upon him,
Nicolas striking him a violent blow on the head
with a short, loaded cudgel. Delorme fell over
without a word, and in a minute his pockets were
rifled. Toni stood by, dazed and unable to move.
It was all over in less than two minutes, and the
three were running away as fast as they could.
Toni knew that Delorme was dead, lying in the
roadway in the dark, his face turned upward toward
the night sky, himself robbed of the money
of which he had robbed Madame Bernard.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2></div>

<p>Next morning, by daylight, the whole region
was aroused. Count Delorme had been found dead,
robbed and murdered, in the park of the Ch&acirc;teau
Bernard. The police appeared in swarms. No one
had seen him at the ch&acirc;teau, and old Madame Bernard
had fainted when told of the murdered man
being found in the park, and had taken to her bed
very ill, so she could not be disturbed. Delorme&rsquo;s
identity was easily established, and it was surmised
that he was on his way to the ch&acirc;teau when he had
met his fate.</p>

<p>Toni listened, with a blanched face, to all the excited
talk and colloquy that went on among the
villagers as well as the circus people about the
strange murder. Suspicion at once fell on the
circus people, but Pierre and Nicolas were old
hands at the business and knew how to manage such
little affairs. They had promptly proceeded, the
first thing next morning, to try for an advance
of money from the manager of the circus, and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ing
refused, they had tried to borrow money from
several of their fellow employees to disguise the
fact that their pockets were well-lined at that very
moment with Delorme&rsquo;s money. Toni had never
thought of this subterfuge, and did not attempt to
borrow a franc. He spent the day in one long
spasm of terror, and in the evening, when the performance
was over and he was going back to his
lodging, his two friends joined him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni,&rdquo; said Nicolas, with a laughing devil in
his eye as he spoke, &ldquo;you must be very careful, for
suspicion might fall on you for the part you took
in our little escapade. You struck the blow, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni stopped, stared, and threw his arms up
above his head in a wild passion of despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not&mdash;I did not&mdash;I did not,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>Then Nicolas, slipping his hand in Toni&rsquo;s pocket,
drew out a twenty-franc gold piece, a coin which
Toni had seldom in his life owned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo7"><img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;&lsquo;This is what you took out of the man&rsquo;s pocket.&rsquo;&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;&lsquo;This is what you took out of the man&rsquo;s pocket.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">&ldquo;This was what you took out of the man&rsquo;s pocket,&rdquo;
said Pierre. It was too much for Toni. They
were walking along the highway toward the village,
in the soft May evening. Toni, quite unsteady on
his legs, sat down by the roadside. He was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>stunned and dazed that he could neither move nor
think nor speak. Pierre and Nicolas walked off
laughing, Pierre, meanwhile having put the twenty-franc
piece in Toni&rsquo;s pocket. When Toni felt
this, he threw the money after them frantically, and
it fell in the road behind them, but they did not see
it. Toni, without knowing this at the time, thereby
accomplished a stroke of justice to these wretches.</p>

<p>He sat there a long time after his two friends
had left him. Presently the power of thought returned
to him, and he said to himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni, here is another terrible secret for you to
carry&mdash;heavier than any yet that you have carried&mdash;too
heavy for you to carry alone. Toni, you are
a coward. If you were not, you would have got
away from Nicolas and Pierre a long time ago.
Now see what they have led you into. Toni, you
must go to Paul Verney and make a clean breast of
it, otherwise, you will live to be guillotined.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had no friend to whom he could go for counsel,
unless he could find Paul Verney. He took
Jacques out of his pocket, and Jacques looked at
him in a friendly way and agreed with him as he
always did, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni, unless you take some steps you will cer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>tainly
be guillotined or sent to prison for life; so
make up your mind to find Paul Verney and tell
him all about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni took this resolution, but the courage which
inspired him to make it did not inspire him, at
once, to carry it into effect. He meant to do it the
first thing next day, but when the next morning
came he put it off until the afternoon, and when
the afternoon came he again delayed. A secret
like that is frightful to keep and more frightful
to tell. And then suddenly their week was up at
Beaupr&eacute;.</p>

<p>After leaving Beaupr&eacute;, they gave performances
in the small towns round about. Interest in the
murder of Delorme had by no means died out, but
rather increased as time passed on and no clue
to the murderer was discovered. Toni had an instinctive
feeling that the police were watching the
circus people. He felt that every one of them was
under suspicion, but he had no tangible proof of
this. It made him long, however, to get away from
the circus. He knew that he was of an age when
his army service might begin at any moment, as his
twentieth birthday was close at hand. He had, in
fact, already been served with notice. He could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>got off, being the only son of a widowed mother,
but it had occurred to him that by serving his time
in the army he might get rid, for a while, of his
two friends, Nicolas and Pierre. A dream came
to him that after his service he would get a place as
teacher in a riding-school. Then he would still have
horses for his friends and companions, but there
would be nothing of Nicolas and Pierre in his life.
The dream grew brighter the more he dwelt on it.
He would go back to Bienville and ask his mother&rsquo;s
pardon, which he had done in every letter that
he had written her, and then she would forgive him.
And he would make her ask for the hand of Denise
for his wife.</p>

<p>Oh, how happy he could be if only he had not
this terrible secret about Count Delorme to carry,
which stayed with him day and night. If he could
get away from the circus, he thought this secret
might then be less terrible to bear. The first step
toward this was soon accomplished by the strong
arm of the law, because Toni found himself, one
June morning, drawn in the conscription. He had
no thought of getting off, because he was his
mother&rsquo;s only son, and presently he found, to his
immense joy, that he was to be one of the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>of recruits who were to report at the cavalry depot
at Beaupr&eacute;.</p>

<p>Beaupr&eacute; was like Bienville in one way, having a
small garrison and being a cavalry depot, but it
was new and modern, unlike Bienville. Although
quite as bright, the barracks and stables were all
new and shining with fresh paint. And oh, what
joy was Toni&rsquo;s when he recalled that Paul Verney
was stationed there! It seemed to him as if what is
called the good God, who had neglected and forgotten
him for seven whole years, had at last relented
and was directing his destiny and showing
him the path to peace.</p>

<p>It was almost two months after Toni&rsquo;s little adventure
in the park of the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard that,
one morning, Sergeant Duval, the father of Denise,
heaved a heavy sigh as he paced the tan-bark in
the riding-school at Beaupr&eacute; and mournfully surveyed
the group of recruits who were to take their
first lesson in <i>voltige</i> or circus riding. There were
about fifty of them. They all came from Paris,
and recruits from Paris are notoriously hard to
break in. They feel a profound contempt for the
&ldquo;rurals,&rdquo; a term which they apply to everybody
outside of Paris. The sergeant, running his eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>over them, had no difficulty in sorting them out, so
to speak, according to their different degrees of
incapacity. About half were clerks, waiters, and
artisans&rsquo; apprentices, town-bred and certain never
to get over their fear and respect for horses. The
other half were porters and laborers and the like,
who could be taught to stick on a horse&rsquo;s back, but
would never acquire any style in riding.</p>

<p>Among them was a stupid-looking young fellow,
rather short but well-made, with very black eyes
and a closely-cropped black poll, whom Sergeant
Duval did not recognize in the least as his old
friend Toni, the unknown aspirant for the hand of
Denise. Toni&rsquo;s apparent fear and dread in the
company of the horses had kept the troopers in a
roar of laughter ever since he had joined. His
awkwardness in the simple riding lesson of the day
before showed what a hand he would make of it in
the more difficult <i>voltige</i>, and his companions had
hustled him to the first place in the line, so they
could see the fun.</p>

<p>Just then Sublieutenant Verney walked into the
riding-hall. He was the same Paul Verney, only
he was twenty-two years old, and was known and
loved by every man and by every horse in the regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>ment.
This triumph was something to be laid at
the feet of Lucie Bernard, whom he had loved ever
since that August afternoon in the park at Bienville,
when she had taken his book away from him
and his heart went with the book. Sublieutenant
Verney was always present at the riding-drill,
whether it was his turn or not, and he dreamed
dreams in which he saw himself as another Murat
or Kellerman, leading vast masses of heavy cavalry
to overwhelm infantry&mdash;for he held to the French
idea that men on horses can ride over men on foot.
His dog, Powder, a smart little fox terrier, was at
his heels.</p>

<p>Now Paul Verney was an especial favorite with
Sergeant Duval, who had known him as boy and
man, who had seen sublieutenants come and go, and
knew the breed well. He looked gloomily at Paul
as he came up and ran his eye casually over the
recruits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty bad lot, eh, Sergeant?&rdquo; said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dreadful, sir. It would have broken your
heart to have seen them in the riding-school yesterday.
Not one of them has any more notion of riding
than a bale of hay has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! Well, you can lick them into shape, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>anybody can,&rdquo; was Paul&rsquo;s reply to this pessimistic
remark.</p>

<p>The specially-trained horse on which greenhorns
learned was then brought in. He was an
intelligent old charger, and when he stood stock-still,
with a trooper holding up his forefoot, his
small, bright eye traveled over the recruits. Then,
suddenly dropping his head, he gave forth a long,
low whinny of disgust, which was almost human in
its significance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Caporal even laughs at them!&rdquo; cried the
sergeant. &ldquo;Now, come here, you bandy-legged
son of a sailor, and get on that horse&rsquo;s back, and
do it with a single spring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was addressed to Toni, who lurched forward
so clumsily that it was seen there was little
hope for him.</p>

<p>The waiting greenhorns watched with a sympathetic
grin Toni&rsquo;s timid and awkward preparations
to spring on Caporal&rsquo;s back. He moved back at
least ten yards, and, lunging forward with the
energy of despair, succeeded in landing on the
horse&rsquo;s crupper, from which he slid to the ground,
and lay groaning as he rubbed his shins. A shout
of laughter, in which every man joined except the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>sergeant, followed this. Even Powder gave two
short, sharp yaps of amusement. The sergeant,
though, was in no laughing mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;are you going to keep
us here all day? Get up and try again!&mdash;and this
time, be sure and land between the horse&rsquo;s ears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Toni, still rubbing his shins, got
up, and going still farther off, made another
clumsy rush. This time, by scrambling with both
hands and feet, he managed to get on Caporal&rsquo;s
back, and then, working forward, he perched himself
almost astride the horse&rsquo;s neck, and said with
a foolish smile:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get any farther forward, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get off!&rdquo; roared the sergeant.</p>

<p>Toni worked backward as he had worked forward,
and slid down behind. Old Caporal, at this,
made a disdainful motion with his hind leg, and
Toni, with a scream, bolted off, yelling: &ldquo;Take
care! take care! he&rsquo;s beginning to kick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The recruits had something else to think of now
in their own efforts to vault on Caporal&rsquo;s back.
Some of them were awkward enough, but all did
better than Toni. Then came the mounting and
dismounting while the horse was galloping round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>in a circle, the sergeant standing in the middle with
a long whip to keep him going.</p>

<p>Toni, meanwhile, had stood with his heart in his
mouth, watching Paul Verney. There was not,
on Paul&rsquo;s part, the slightest recognition of his old
friend. Toni&rsquo;s shock of black hair, which was as
much a part of him as his black eyes and Jacques
in his pocket, had been closely-cropped, and he
had grown a black mustache, which quite changed
the character of his face, and he looked away from
Paul Verney, not wishing for recognition at that
time and place.</p>

<p>Toni was also the first man to attempt the
mounting and dismounting. He ran around the
circle twice before he seemed to screw up enough
courage to try to mount, and could not then until
the sergeant&rsquo;s long whip had tickled his legs
sharply. In vain he clutched at the horse&rsquo;s mane,
and made ineffectual struggles. Once he fell under
Caporal&rsquo;s feet, and only by the horse&rsquo;s intelligence
escaped being trodden on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the horse were as great a fool as you are,&rdquo;&mdash;roared
the sergeant.</p>

<p>Crack went the sergeant&rsquo;s whip as Toni got on
his legs. Timidity and stupidity have to be got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>out of any man who has to serve in a dragoon regiment,
and the sergeant proceeded to take them out
of Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, my man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have got
to learn to do that trick now and here&mdash;do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Sergeant,&rdquo; moaned Toni, &ldquo;I am afraid of
the horse, I swear I am&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sergeant&rsquo;s reply to this was to run toward
Toni with uplifted whip. Old Caporal, supposing
the whip was meant for him, suddenly broke into a
furious gallop. Toni darted toward him, lighted
like a bird with both feet on the horse&rsquo;s back, folded
his arms, stuck his right leg out as Caporal sped
around the circle, changed to his left, turned a
somersault, stood on his head on the horse&rsquo;s back
for a whole minute, and then with a &ldquo;Houp-la!&rdquo;
flung himself backward to the ground, and, approaching
the sergeant, stood calmly at attention.
The roof of the riding-hall echoed with thunders of
laughter and applause, Sublieutenant Verney leading
off, capering in his delight, and pinching Powder
to make him join his yelping to the uproar.
The sergeant stood grinning with satisfaction. He
was one of the few sergeants who wanted a man to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>ride well and cared very little what share of praise
or blame accrued to himself in the doing of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you were in the circus?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sergeant&mdash;ever since I was thirteen,&rdquo; answered
Toni, who had thrown off his stupid expression
like a mask and stood up alert, cool, with
a glint of a smile in his eye. Then he stopped. He
had not forgotten those magnanimous offers made
by the sergeant to his mother to marry her for the
purpose of thrashing him. His old cowardice returned
to him and he trembled at the idea of the
coming recognition by the sergeant. He certainly
would not consider a circus rider a match for
Denise, who, by this time, must be a young lady.</p>

<p>The seven years which had changed Toni and
Paul from boys into men, had apparently passed
over the sergeant without leaving the smallest sign
on him, but they had marked Toni so that Sergeant
Duval so far had no idea that he was the
Toni whom he had yearned to thrash.</p>

<p>A light had been breaking upon Paul Verney&rsquo;s
mind. There had been something strangely familiar
in the awkward recruit. A thrill of remembrance
swept over Paul Verney, but Bienville and
Toni were far from his mind then, and besides,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>Toni, as a dirty, shock-headed boy, had been the
personification of boyish grace, while this fellow
had been the embodiment of awkwardness in walking
as well as riding. But now things began to
grow clearer. As for Toni, the old joy and love of
Paul came over him with a rush. He straightened
himself up, stood at attention, and turned his gaze
full on the young lieutenant.</p>

<p>Paul came up close to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this&mdash;isn&rsquo;t this Toni?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>For answer, Toni saluted and said, &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
He had learned enough, during his short enlistment,
to say that. And then, surreptitiously
opening his hand, Paul caught a glimpse of the
old battered Jacques in Toni&rsquo;s palm. He covered it
up quickly again. Paul Verney could not trust
himself with all the recruits standing by, and the
riding lesson in progress, to say more than:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come to my quarters at twelve o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo;&mdash;and
turned away.</p>

<p>Sergeant Duval then recognized Toni, and with
severe disapproval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you have turned up at last!&rdquo; he said sternly,
&ldquo;while your poor mother has been breaking her
heart in Bienville these seven years about you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Well, I will talk with you later. I don&rsquo;t suppose
you learned any good in the circus except how to
ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this could not crush Toni. He had felt all
his perplexities and miseries dwindle since he had
spoken to Paul Verney. Paul always had such a
sensible, level head, and knew well that plain,
straight path out of difficulties&mdash;telling the truth
and standing by the consequences.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2></div>

<p>At Paul Verney&rsquo;s quarters, therefore, on the
stroke of twelve, Toni presented himself. He had
laid aside his pretended awkwardness and when he
stood, erect and at attention, in his dragoon uniform,
he was a model of lithe and manly grace.
His circus training had developed his naturally
good figure, and he was as well built a young
fellow as one would wish to see. He was handsome,
too, in his own odd, picturesque way. His teeth
were as white as ever and shone now in a happy
grin, while his black eyes were full of the mingled
archness and softness that had distinguished the
dirty little Toni of ten years before.</p>

<p>Paul was as happy as Toni, and the two eyed
each other with delight when they were alone.
Paul stepped softly to the door and, locking it,
held out his arms to Toni, and the two hugged
each other as if they were ten years old, instead of
being twenty and twenty-two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Toni,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;tell me all that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>have been doing. I don&rsquo;t suppose you learned anything
good in the circus except riding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what Sergeant Duval said to me,&rdquo;
replied Toni, and then the memory of all he had
suffered since his association with Pierre and Nicolas
came to his mind and his expressive eyes glowed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true, Pa&mdash;I mean, Lieutenant, that I got
into bad company when I was in the circus, and I
want to tell you all about it. But first tell me
something about Bienville. I have written regularly
to my mother, but I was afraid to give her
my address.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo; asked Paul.</p>

<p>Toni&rsquo;s eyes wandered around the room aimlessly,
and came back to Paul&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always was afraid,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your mother is alive and well,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;but
heart-broken about you. What induced you, Toni,
to run away as you did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo; That one franc still
loomed large in Toni&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;I took a franc from
my mother&mdash;only a single franc, to go to the circus,
and Clery, the tailor, caught me and accused
me of taking the money and whipped me and said
he would have me arrested and then&mdash;oh, I was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>frightened! I have been frightened every time I
thought of that franc in these more than seven
years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some story of the sort got out,&rdquo; answered
Paul, &ldquo;but your mother always denied it. I don&rsquo;t
really think she missed the franc that you took out
of the box. But Toni, what a fool you were&mdash;what
a monumental fool you were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni shook his head. &ldquo;And a coward, too, sir,&rdquo;
he said. It was very difficult to add that &ldquo;sir&rdquo;
when he spoke to Paul, and equally strange for
Paul to hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Toni, don&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;sir&rsquo; when we are
alone&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it. As soon as we step outside
in the corridor it shall be &lsquo;my man&rsquo; and &lsquo;sir,&rsquo; but
when the door is locked we are Paul and Toni.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni nodded delightedly. &ldquo;It never would have
worked,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when the door is locked on us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never could understand that cowardice in
you,&rdquo; said Paul. &ldquo;You were the most timid boy I
ever saw in my life about some things, and the most
insensible to fear about others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but the reason why you can&rsquo;t understand
it is because you are not afraid of anything.
I am not afraid of horses, nor of railroad wrecks&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>I
have been in one or two and was not frightened&mdash;nor
fires, nor&mdash;nor any of those things which come
on a man unawares and where he has just to
stand still, keep cool and do what he is told to do.
But when it comes to other things, like going
against another man&rsquo;s will&mdash;oh, Paul&mdash;I am the
biggest coward alive and I know it. I would never
volunteer for the forlorn hope, but if there was an
officer by the side of me with a pistol I&rsquo;d march to
the mouth of hell, because I would be more afraid of
the officer than I would be of hell. That&rsquo;s the sort
of courage I have,&rdquo; and Toni grinned shamelessly.
&ldquo;But before I tell you all of the evil things that
have befallen me, tell me some more about Bienville.
How does my mother look?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About twenty-five years older since you left.
And Toni, you must write to her this very day&mdash;do
you understand me?&mdash;to-day, and I shall write
to her that she may get our letters together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Toni. &ldquo;And how about little
Denise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Toni said this, he blushed under his sunburned
skin, and Paul laughed. They were both very
young men and their thoughts naturally turned in
the same direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Denise is here with her father. Mademoiselle
Duval has sold out the bakery shop, so I suppose
you will no longer be in love with Denise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni giggled like a school-girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I never have
thought about any girl except Denise, but I can
only think of her now as a little creature in a
checked apron with her flaxen plait hanging down
her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is an extremely pretty young lady, and a
great belle with the young corporals. Mademoiselle
Duval has given her a nice little dot of ten thousand
francs to her fortune. But, for that reason,
the sergeant, who is a level-headed old fellow, is
looking around very carefully before he disposes of
Denise&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni struck his forehead with his open palm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Denise is not for me. I am
only a private soldier&mdash;I never will be anything
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can be something else if you choose,&rdquo; said
Paul Verney.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I have been in the circus. The sergeant
will never forgive me that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul shook his head dolefully. It was pretty bad,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>and the sergeant was a great stickler for correctness
of behavior. But Paul, being a lover himself,
and a poor man, who sincerely loved a rich girl,
sympathized with Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must wait and see. One
thing is certain&mdash;if Mademoiselle Denise takes a
notion into her head to like you the sergeant will
give in, for he is a very doting father. But, Toni,
you must behave yourself after this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; replied Toni. &ldquo;When I tell you
what I have got by bad association, you will understand
that I mean what I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then Toni, seating himself at Paul&rsquo;s command,
poured out the story of all that he had suffered
at the hands of Nicolas and Pierre, ending
up with that last dreadful account of the murder of
Delorme.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that secret, Paul, I am carrying,&rdquo; cried
poor Toni, putting his fists to his eyes, into which
the tears started, &ldquo;and sometimes it&rsquo;s near to killing
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul listened closely. He realized, quite as fully
as Toni did, the position in which Toni had got
himself, and did not make light of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think any one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>regretted Delorme&rsquo;s death. He was the worst sort
of a rascal&mdash;a gentleman rascal. You know he was
the first husband of Madame Ravenel at Bienville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have seen many women in the seven years that
I have been traveling about the world,&rdquo; said Toni,
&ldquo;but I never saw one who seemed to radiate modesty
and goodness as Madame Ravenel. Do the
Ravenels still live at Bienville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The color came into Paul&rsquo;s face, which
was pink already. &ldquo;They live there as quietly as
ever, but much respected. They are no longer
avoided, but still live very quietly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni, looking into Paul&rsquo;s eyes, saw his face grow
redder and redder, and his mouth come wide open,
as Toni said, with a sidelong glance and his old-time
grin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mademoiselle Lucie?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beautiful as a dream,&rdquo; replied Paul, with a
lover&rsquo;s fondness for superlatives, &ldquo;and charming
beyond words. Only,&rdquo; here his countenance fell,
&ldquo;she has a great fortune from America, and why
should she look at a sublieutenant in a dragoon
regiment with two thousand francs a year and his
pay?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;If I recollect Mademoiselle Lucie aright,&rdquo; answered
Toni, &ldquo;and she takes a notion into her head
to like you, her grandmother will give in, because
you used to tell me, in the old days when we sat in
the little cranny on the bridge, that Mademoiselle
Lucie said her grandmother allowed her to do exactly
as she pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul laughed at having his own words turned
against him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Toni!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;we are a couple of
poor devils who love above our stations, both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you,&rdquo; replied Toni with perfect sincerity.
&ldquo;The greatest lady that ever lived might be proud
and glad to marry you.&rdquo; And as this was said by
a person who had known Paul ever since he could
walk, in an intimacy closer than that of a brother,
it meant something. &ldquo;I have seen Mademoiselle
Lucie,&rdquo; continued Toni. &ldquo;I saw her one morning
about two months ago, when you and she were riding
together. She rides beautifully&mdash;I could not
teach her anything in that line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She does a great many things beautifully, and
she is the most generous, warm-hearted creature in
the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And just the sort of a young lady to fall in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>love with a poor sublieutenant and throw herself
and her money into his arms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if the poor lieutenant had the feelings of a
gentleman he could not accept such a sacrifice. He
would run away to escape it.&rdquo; Paul grew quite
gloomy as he said this, and stroked his blond mustache
thoughtfully. But it is not natural at twenty-two,
with youth and health and a good conscience
and abounding spirits, to despair. It was all very
difficult, but Paul did not, on that account, cease
loving Lucie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And does she still go to Bienville every year to
visit Madame Ravenel?&rdquo; asked Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, every year, except two years that she spent
in America. She is just home now, and very&mdash;very&mdash;American.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul shook his head mournfully as he said this.
He had all the prim French ideas, and the dash of
American in Lucie frightened him, brave as he
was.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 209px;">
<a id="illo8"><img src="images/i_168.jpg" width="209" alt="Lucie." title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Lucie.</p>

<p class="smgap">&ldquo;But, on her last visit to Bienville, before she
went to America, her grandmother sent with her a
carriage and a retinue of horses and servants, which
quite dazzled Bienville. I think Mademoiselle Lucie
bullies her grandmother shamefully. And whom do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>you think she pays most attention to of all the
people in Bienville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni reflected a moment. &ldquo;Monsieur and Madame
Verney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s light blue eyes sparkled. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it.
She has my mother with her all the time, and as
for my father, he adores her, and Lucie actually
pinches his arms and pulls his whiskers when she
wants to be impertinent to him. You know she
takes advantage of being half American to do the
most unconventional things, and my father quite
adores her&mdash;almost as much so as his son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks to me,&rdquo; remarked Toni, &ldquo;as if Mademoiselle
Lucie were taking things in her own hands,
and meant to marry you whether you will or not.
I have often heard that heiresses run great risks
of being married for their money and then finding
their husbands very unkind. Perhaps Mademoiselle
Lucie knows this and wants to marry a man like
yourself, who loves her for herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Mademoiselle Lucie has too much sense
to marry me,&rdquo; answered poor Paul quite honestly.
&ldquo;I think it is simply her kindness and generosity
that make her kind to me and affectionate to my
father and mother. She will marry some great man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>&mdash;a
count or a duke perhaps&mdash;there are still
a few left in France&mdash;and not throw herself away
on a sublieutenant of dragoons,&rdquo; and Paul sighed
deeply.</p>

<p>The pair spent nearly two hours together. It
seemed to Toni as if he could never be satiated with
looking at his old friend, as pink and white and
blond as ever. Paul felt the same toward Toni,
and when, in the old way, Toni took Jacques out
of his pocket and showed him, it was as if seven
years passed away into mist and they were boys together.
But at last Paul was obliged to dismiss
Toni, who went back to his quarters with a heart
lighter than it had been for seven years.</p>

<p>And he was to see more of Paul than he had
dared to hope, for Paul had promised to arrange
that Toni should be his soldier servant. The present
incumbent was not exactly to Paul&rsquo;s liking and
he was only too glad to replace him with Toni.</p>

<p>There was work waiting for him, and that, too,
under Sergeant Duval&rsquo;s eye, and Toni did it with
the energy of a man who is determined on pleasing
the father of his beloved. No one would have recognized,
in this smart, active, natty trooper, the
dirty idle Toni of his boyhood. Sergeant Duval,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>however, was a skeptic by nature, and he waited to
see more of Toni before reversing the notion he
had formed of that young man. He had heard
something, on his annual visits to Bienville, of
Toni&rsquo;s fondness for Denise, and, when she was in
short frocks and pinafores, had sometimes joked
her about it, but Denise, who blushed at the least
little thing, would hide her head on her father&rsquo;s
shoulder and almost weep at the idea that she had
even glanced at a boy.</p>

<p>Toni was longing to ask after Denise, but he
dared not. As soon as he had a moment&rsquo;s time to
himself&mdash;and a recruit lately joined has not much
leisure&mdash;he wrote a long letter to his mother. He
did not write very well, and was a reckless speller,
but that letter carried untold happiness and relief
with it to the Widow Marcel at Bienville. His duties
as Paul&rsquo;s servant began at once. Toni was not overindustrious,
but if he had to work for any one he
would wish to work for Paul.</p>

<p>And then came a radiant time with Toni&mdash;a time
when life seemed to him all fair. He managed to
put that secret horror of Nicolas and Pierre out of
his mind as they were out of his sight. He got his
mother&rsquo;s forgiveness by return of post, and he laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>aside all the fear he had had of Nicolas and Pierre,
and enjoyed the sight and the occasional society of
the two beings who, with his mother, were nearest
to him of the world&mdash;Paul Verney and Denise. He
dared not mention Denise&rsquo;s name to Sergeant Duval,
who preserved the most unfeeling reticence
about her toward Toni. The sergeant had no mind
to encourage the attentions of young recruits, just
out of the circus, to his pretty daughter with her
splendid dot of ten thousand francs.</p>

<p>Toni, however, knew that the time of his service
would come to an end in a year, and then he would
be able to carry out that beautiful scheme that had
haunted him during his circus life. He would become
an instructor in a riding-school and earn big
wages, as much as two hundred and fifty francs the
month, and meanwhile he would lead so correct a
life that even Sergeant Duval would be forced to
approve of him. All these resolutions were very
much increased by the first sight he caught of Denise.
It was about a fortnight after he joined,
and during that time he had kept his eyes open for
the lady of his love. Although Sergeant Duval had
quarters at the barracks, Denise and Mademoiselle
Duval lived in lodgings in the town, and Toni did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>not have many opportunities of going into the
town. One Sunday evening, however, a beautiful
August Sunday, Toni found himself standing in
the public square where the band played merrily
and one of those open air balls, which are so French
and so charming, was going on. Ranged on benches
around were the older women, and among them
Toni at once recognized the tall, angular, black
figure of Mademoiselle Duval; and whirling around
in the arms of a handsome dragoon with a beautiful
pair of black mustaches, much finer than Toni&rsquo;s,
was Denise. Toni&rsquo;s heart jumped into his mouth,
his soul leaped into his eyes. It was Denise, of the
acacia tree, and the buns, of long ago.</p>

<p>She was as blond, as modest, as neat as ever, but
far prettier. Her fair hair was twisted up on her
shapely head, on which sat a coquettish white hat.
She wore a white muslin gown, with the short, full
skirt much beruffled. Denise would have liked a
train, but Mademoiselle Duval frowned sternly on
such unbecoming frivolities as trained gowns for
a sergeant&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Denise had developed into as much of a coquette
as Lucie Bernard had been, only in a different direction.
Lucie achieved her conquests by a charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>boldness, a bewitching unconventionality. Denise
Duval succeeded in attracting the attention of the
other sex by a demureness and quaint propriety
which were immensely effective in their way.</p>

<p>Toni, having some instinctive knowledge of this,
determined to proceed with great caution and military
prudence. He would strive to carry the fortress
of Denise&rsquo;s affections by gradual approaches
and not by assault. So, in pursuance of this plan,
he walked up to Mademoiselle Duval and making
a low bow said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Duval, may I recall myself to
your memory? I am Toni Marcel, the son of Madame
Marcel, of Bienville, and had the honor of
knowing you when I was a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duval gave him one grim look, and
then cried out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you very well, Toni. You were the
worst boy in Bienville, and as dirty as you were
bad. Oh, how much trouble did you give your
mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was not a very auspicious beginning for a
young man who wished to become the nephew-in-law
of the lady he addressed, but Toni was not
deficient in the sort of courage which could take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>him through an emergency like that. He only said
hypocritically, and with another bow and a sigh of
penitence:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mademoiselle, every word that you say is
true. I know I was very naughty and very idle,
and my mother was far too patient with me. I gave
her a great deal of trouble, but I hope to be a comfort
to her in the future. I had a letter from her
only yesterday in which, like the rest of your sex,
Mademoiselle, she showed a beautiful spirit of forgiveness.
I hope that she will come to visit me for
a few days before long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duval was not greatly softened by
this speech, but seeing Toni disposed to take a
scolding meekly, she invited him to sit down by her
side, when she harangued him on all his iniquities
for the last seven years. The sergeant had told her
that Toni had been in the circus and that was
enough. Mademoiselle Duval warned Toni that
all circus people were foredoomed to hell-fire, and
that he would probably lead the procession. Toni
took the attack on himself very meekly, but said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you Mademoiselle, there were some
good people in the circus&mdash;some good women,
even.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good women, did you say?&rdquo; screamed Mademoiselle
Duval, &ldquo;wearing tights and spangles, and
turning somersaults!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni bethought him of the time when there was
an outbreak of scarlet fever in the circus company
and how these same painted ladies in tights and
spangles stood by one another and nursed each
other and each other&rsquo;s children day and night, and
uttered no word of complaint or reproach. He
knew more than Mademoiselle Duval on the subject
of the goodness and the wickedness which dwell in
the hearts of men. He told Mademoiselle Duval,
however, the story of the outbreak of scarlet fever.
He had a natural eloquence which stood him in good
stead, and Mademoiselle Duval, who was one of the
best women in the world and had a soft heart, although
a sharp tongue, was almost brought to tears
by Toni&rsquo;s story.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo9"><img src="images/i_176.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;There was a softness, almost a tenderness, in her look.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;There was a softness, almost a tenderness, in her look.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">Just then Denise&rsquo;s cavalier brought her back to
her aunt, and Toni, jumping up, profoundly saluted
Denise. His soul rushed into his eyes, those
handsome, daredevil black eyes which the prim and
proper Denise had secretly admired from her babyhood.
She glanced back at him as she courtesied to
him with great propriety, and something in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>face made Toni&rsquo;s pulses bound with joy. There was
a softness, almost a tenderness, in her look which
Toni, having some knowledge of the world, interpreted
to his own advantage. Denise&rsquo;s own heart
was palpitating, not tumultuously like Toni&rsquo;s, but
with a gentle quickness which was new to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Toni, calling Denise
Mademoiselle for the first time, &ldquo;how well I remember
you in my happy days at Bienville, when you
used to give me buns under the acacia tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped. A soft blush came into Denise&rsquo;s
fair cheeks. She smiled and looked at him and then
away from him. Denise remembered the bench under
the acacia tree and all that had happened there
well enough. Denise knew then, and knew now,
that when the Toni of those days gave up something
to eat to a small girl, his feelings were very
deeply engaged to her. She recollected in particular
the first afternoon the Ravenels took tea with the
Verneys that Toni had selected one beautiful, ripe
plum, and after eying it longingly, had put his
arm around her neck and put the plum in her
mouth, and what he had said then. Her blushing
now revealed it all to Toni.</p>

<p>Suddenly the band struck up a waltz, Toni
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>politely asked Denise to favor him with her hand
for the dance, and they went off together. The
moon smiled softly at them, and even the electric
lights had a kind of tenderness in their glare,
when Toni, clasping Denise in his arms for the first
time, began to whirl around with her to the rhythm
of the music. He felt himself raised above the earth&mdash;all
his fears, all his evil-doing had departed from
him&mdash;he felt, poor Toni, as if he would never be
afraid of Nicolas and Pierre again, and as if that
waltz was a foretaste of Heaven for him.</p>

<p>And Denise, too, was happy. He saw it in her
shy eyes, in the softness of her smile, and presently
Toni drew her closer to him and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Denise, Denise, do you remember?&rdquo; and Denise
whispered back, &ldquo;Yes, Toni, I remember all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so as it was with Paul Verney and Lucie
Bernard, they called each other by their first names
when they were alone.</p>

<p>Presently in the mazes of the dance Toni looked
up and there was Paul Verney passing through the
square. He caught Toni&rsquo;s eye and Toni grinned
back at him rapturously. When the music stopped,
Toni, putting Denise&rsquo;s hand within his arm, escorted
her back to the bench where Mademoiselle Duval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>sat knitting in the electric light. He contrived to
pass directly in front of Paul Verney, whom he
saluted respectfully, and Paul bowed low to Denise
and said to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle, we are both natives of Bienville,
and I am most happy to see you here with your
worthy aunt and your respected father,&rdquo; and then
Paul, with an eye single to Toni&rsquo;s interests, walked
on the other side of Denise up to where Mademoiselle
Duval sat and promptly claimed acquaintance
with her. In the old days at Bienville there had not
been such a tremendous difference between Paul
Verney, the poor advocate&rsquo;s son, and the children
of the pastry shop and the confectioner. Now Paul
was an officer, but he was very pleasant and gentlemanlike,
however, though quite dignified, and gave
himself no haughty airs. He inquired with the
deepest solicitude after Mademoiselle Duval&rsquo;s
health, remembered gratefully sundry tarts and
cakes she had given him in the old days, and then
said to her, in the most unblushing manner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, Mademoiselle, we have here another citizen
of Bienville, Marcel&rdquo;&mdash;it was the first time that
Paul had ever called Toni, Marcel, in his life&mdash;&ldquo;who,
I assure you, is worthy of our old town. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>is strictly attentive to his duties, and the best rider
in my troop. I predict that he will be a corporal before
his enlistment is out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And thus having advanced Toni&rsquo;s cause with his
prospective aunt-in-law, Paul Verney withdrew,
winking surreptitiously at Toni as he went off. It
was impossible that Mademoiselle Duval should not
revise her opinion of Toni after this testimony
from his officer, so Toni at once found himself in a
most acceptable position with Mademoiselle Duval.
He danced twice more with Denise, carrying her off
in the face of a couple of corporals, and, by his devoted
attentions and insidious flattery of Mademoiselle
Duval, gained that lady&rsquo;s good-will. He
would have liked to escort his old friends back to
their lodging, but, as he explained, he barely had
time to reach the barracks before the tap of the
drum, and he scurried off, the happiest trooper in
Beaupr&eacute; that night.</p>

<p>When he neared the quadrangle on which the
barracks faced, he overtook Paul Verney, and as he
rushed past he whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, dear Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In that moment he could have not refrained, to
save his life, from calling his lieutenant Paul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2></div>

<p>It was a bond of sympathy between Paul and
Toni that each should, as it were, love above his station.
Paul was a frequent visitor at the Ch&acirc;teau
Bernard, and was regarded by the stately and imposing
Madame Bernard with very mixed feelings.
The old lady looked on Lucie very much as a hen
does which has hatched out a duckling among her
brood. Madame Bernard was a representative of
the strictness of manners, such as had prevailed in
France fifty years before.</p>

<p>Although dragon-like in her manner, Madame
Bernard was at heart a grandmother, and that tells
the tale. Lucie was her idol, and the two years the
young girl had spent with her mother&rsquo;s family in
America had been one long nightmare to Madame
Bernard. When she returned she was the same
Lucie, with an added dash of Americanism which
frightened Madame Bernard almost out of her wits.
Nevertheless there was something about this wild
young creature, this half American, something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>which gave Madame Bernard instinctive confidence
that she could never commit the fearful error of
Sophie Ravenel.</p>

<p>Madame Bernard was now more than seventy
years of age, and quite unequal to opposing Lucie&rsquo;s
will, and Lucie, at twenty years of age, reigned
over the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard in a manner that terrified
and enchanted all under her sway. She had,
somewhere in her beautiful head, a nugget of American
common sense&mdash;a thing which none of those
around her quite understood, only they saw that
Mademoiselle Lucie never came to grief in any of
her pranks and schemes. She was, of course, surrounded
by admirers. Madame Bernard had been
considering offers of marriage for her ever since
her eighteenth year, and had nearly arranged one
or two for her of the most advantageous description,
but what should this madcap Lucie do but
laugh at every one of these desirable lovers, declaring
that she did not mean to marry until she was
quite ready, and might not marry at all. This latter
grotesque idea mortified Madame Bernard, who
had already promised no less than six ambitious
mamas that in a year or two she was sure that Lucie
would come to her senses. Then Lucie was given to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>joking, a practice which Madame Bernard had
never heard of any girl indulging, and actually
made fun of the excellent <i>partis</i> which Madame
Bernard offered for her consideration, drew caricatures
of them, wrote nonsense verses about them,
and otherwise amused herself at their expense.</p>

<p>Madame Bernard observed that the sandy-haired
young sublieutenant, Paul Verney, cool, calm, and
matter-of-fact, seemed to have a singular influence,
and that for good, over Lucie.</p>

<p>Their meeting had come about in the most natural
way possible. On Lucie&rsquo;s return from America
she had gone to Bienville to pay Madame Ravenel
that longed for visit. Her coming upset the whole
town, and was of itself a cyclone. With the rash
generosity of youth Lucie, who now understood
Sophie&rsquo;s sad history, took on herself the task of
placing the Ravenels upon the footing which she
thought they deserved. This meant bringing, as
she had promised to do in her childish days long
ago, a retinue of horses and carriages and servants
with her, likewise of dazzling gowns and ravishing
hats, and making her visit one long fête. The
Ravenels, wiser than little Lucie, tried to curb her,
but as well try to curb a wandering zephyr as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Lucie Bernard, with a noble and generous impulse
in her heart. The people of Bienville were a kindly
set on whom the self-respecting seclusion of the
Ravenels had not been without its impress. When
ambitious mamas and impressionable young officers
found that the only way to make any terms with
this child of brilliant destiny was to accept those she
loved at the value she placed on them, it was not so
difficult to accomplish. The Ravenels, in that fortnight
of Lucie&rsquo;s visit, got more invitations than
they had received in all the years they had lived in
Bienville.</p>

<p>Among the first was to drink tea in the Verneys&rsquo;
garden&mdash;a modest form of entertainment suited to
the advocate&rsquo;s means. It happened to be Madame
Verney&rsquo;s fête-day, a day which Paul always spent
with his mother, if possible. Madame Verney had
not only written, but telegraphed, for Paul to get
leave if he possibly could. It was a long distance to
travel to spend twenty-four hours with his mother,
and Paul&rsquo;s two thousand francs&rsquo; allowance, besides
his pay, had a habit of walking off mysteriously,
just like the allowances of other young officers, but
one line at the end of Madame Verney&rsquo;s letter settled
the matter for Sublieutenant Paul Verney.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>The line ran thus&mdash;&ldquo;Mademoiselle Lucie Bernard
will be staying with the Ravenels&mdash;her first visit
since her return from America&mdash;and the Ravenels
are coming to tea with us on my fête-day.&rdquo; Paul
went that moment and asked boldly for a week&rsquo;s
leave.</p>

<p>He got to Bienville at noon on the great day,
and at five o&rsquo;clock, when the little festivity was
inaugurated in the garden and the Ravenels entered,
there was Paul, still pink and white and
sandy-haired, not spoiled with beauty, but adorned
with manliness. With the new affectation of the
young French officers he adopted the modern
fashion of discarding his uniform on every possible
occasion and wearing citizens&rsquo; clothes whenever
he could, but on this day he could not but remember
what Lucie had said, a long time ago, about his
wearing a uniform next time they should meet. So
he put on his handsome new undress uniform and
looked a soldier. His mother admired him immensely,
so did his father, and so, in fact, did Lucie,
when that young lady, in a dazzling white costume
and charming white hat and white shoes, came
tripping along the garden path. Paul blushed
from his head to his heels as he made her a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>bow, but Lucie, who had acquired the startling
American fashion of shaking hands with any and
everybody, deliberately slipped her little hand in
his and gave him a look from under her long eyelashes
which said as plainly as words&mdash;&ldquo;Welcome,
Paul.&rdquo; And by Madame Verney&rsquo;s tea-table in the
little garden their hearts were cemented without
one word being spoken between them.</p>

<p>After that Paul was with Lucie every moment he
could contrive while he was in Bienville, cursing
himself meanwhile for being a villain in forcing his
company on that radiant creature with her millions
of francs. He had, however, the best excuse in the
world&mdash;he could not help it. And when he found
that he would shortly be sent to Beaupr&eacute;, in the
immediate neighborhood of the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard,
he was the happiest and likewise the most miserable
creature alive. Lucie was unblushingly happy and
demanded that as soon as he arrived at Beaupr&eacute; he
should present himself at the ch&acirc;teau and pay his
respects to Madame Bernard. Of course, he did it,
wicked as he knew it to be, with the result that he
was the only man whom Lucie really encouraged.
And in a little while, as natures quickly adjust
themselves to each other, Paul acquired a species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>of control over Lucie, a thing which no one but
Sophie Ravenel had ever done before.</p>

<p>She generally wished to do what was right, but
on the occasions when she wished to do what was
wrong, Madame Bernard saw that the sandy-haired
young sublieutenant could turn Lucie from her
way. In particular, he could dissuade her from
doing many rash things, sometimes innocent, sometimes
dangerous. She was an accomplished, though
reckless rider and when she would have ridden a
horse which, rightly named Comet, had run away
once, and might be depended on to do so again,
Paul Verney had managed to do more with her by a
few words than all of Madame Bernard&rsquo;s prayers
and the exhortations of the head groom.</p>

<p>Paul often came over to the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard
and, on one special afternoon he found Comet saddled
and waiting, and when he went into the drawing-room,
Madame Bernard implored him to try to
persuade Lucie not to ride Comet. Presently Lucie
tripped in, looking charming in her riding-habit,
and with the light of contradiction in her eyes.
Paul, she knew, objected to her riding the horse,
and she was prepared to defy him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Paul quietly, &ldquo;it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>would scarcely be judicious for you to ride Comet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucie, who was proud of her horsemanship, resented
this promptly, and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I wish to ride Comet. I am perfectly capable
of managing him, and besides, he is not really
vicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last may be true, Mademoiselle, but I think
you are mistaken in the former. You have no more
real control over Comet than a butterfly has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Lucie tapped her whip smartly on
the mantelpiece, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Monsieur Verney&mdash;I
must beg you to excuse me&mdash;good afternoon,&rdquo; and
was going out of the room when Paul, who had
walked over from his quarters, asked of Madame
Bernard:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, may I have one of your horses saddled,
and follow Mademoiselle Lucie on her dangerous
ride?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, you may,&rdquo; replied poor Madame Bernard,
wringing her hands, &ldquo;take anything you may
find in the stables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucie burst out laughing. &ldquo;And do you mean
to ride in that dress?&rdquo; she asked of Paul, who had
on a frock coat and held a silk hat in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the dress that I would choose to ride in,
Mademoiselle,&rdquo; answered Paul, laughing. &ldquo;I dare
say I shall look quite ridiculous in this costume
scampering after you&mdash;everybody we meet will
surmise the reason&mdash;nevertheless, I shall go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will not,&rdquo; cried Lucie, running out of
doors to where the horses were standing. She was
not equal to the impertinence of having her groom
assist her on horseback with an officer and a gentleman
standing by, and, furthermore, the groom
understood the situation and kept discreetly in the
background. Paul further astounded her by directing
the groom to ride to the stables and have a
horse saddled for him and brought at once. Lucie
was so angry that she had to wink her dark, bright
eyes to keep the tears from coming, but Paul was
as cool and as calm as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Monsieur,&rdquo; said Lucie, in a trembling
voice, &ldquo;I shall ride Comet&mdash;of that you may
be sure. You may force yourself on me to-day,
but you can not do it every day, and I shall ride
what horse I please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul, urged by his love and tenderness for her,
said words for which he thought he would have died
rather than have spoken:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Lucie, if you are as reckless as that you
will break my heart. Forgive me for calling you
by your name, but don&rsquo;t you remember, seven years
ago, in the park at Bienville, you told me that when
we were grown up we should call each other Paul
and Lucie in private?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul stopped. He felt as if he were guilty of a
crime in saying these words to that enchanting
creature, who would marry so far above him in
every way. All at once he saw a vision of his
father&rsquo;s modest house at Bienville, and thought of
his own small allowance and slender pay, and reckoned
himself the greatest fool in existence. But
Lucie&rsquo;s reply to this was to look at him with a mysterious
smile on her expressive face, and to say
softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the first time that you have ever called
me by name, Paul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were standing on the lawn, in full view of
dozens of eyes, while this was passing. Paul looked
at her in dumb admiration and despair, but there
was nothing in the least despairing in the smile
which presently rippled over Lucie&rsquo;s face, with her
eyes all fire and dew. The fact is that Mademoiselle
Lucie had been very much in love with Su<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>blieutenant
Paul Verney, ever since they had been
children together in the park at Bienville, and
wished him to know it, and she was in love with the
best part of him&mdash;his courage, his modesty, his
good sense, his clean and upright life, and having
the American archness in her nature, she saw the
humorous side of it and could not forbear laughing
at poor Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a gentleman should
keep his word. You promised me that you would
call me by my first name in private, and you have
only done it once, and now you speak as if you
would never do it again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul secretly thought Lucie, just as he had always
done, a very improper little person, but quite
irresistible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; said Lucie airily, flicking the
blossoms of a tall, blue hydrangea nodding gravely
in the sun, &ldquo;I intend to call you Paul, in private
that is&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think I shall go to ride this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And promise me,&rdquo; said Paul, coming a little
closer and looking at her earnestly, &ldquo;that you won&rsquo;t
ride Comet any more&mdash;Lucie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise then, Paul,&rdquo; replied Lucie, with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>affectation of a meekness which was far removed
from her, and which she only used for purposes of
her own. Then the horses were sent away, and the
two walked together across the lawn and into the
drawing-room where Madame Bernard sat in an
agony.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall not ride this afternoon, Grandmama,&rdquo;
said Lucie. &ldquo;Monsieur Paul would insist on going
with me, and he would look so utterly ridiculous on
horseback dressed as he is that I was ashamed to be
seen with him; so, instead, he will stay and have tea
with us, and meanwhile we shall go and play billiards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This charmed Madame Bernard, who concluded
that the next time Lucie was refractory she would
send post-haste for Sublieutenant Verney to manage
her. It is not to be supposed that Madame Bernard
did not see the possibilities of the future as
well as Madame Verney had done long years before,
when Paul and Lucie had played together as children.
But Madame Bernard, like many other
women who know much of the world, was beginning
dimly to reach a just estimate of things. After
having seen many marriages and a considerable
number of divorces she had realized that it was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>man, and not the title or the estate, with which a
woman must reckon. And Paul was so very attentive
to Madame Bernard, picking up her ball of
worsted when she was knitting, and giving her his
advice, when asked, regarding the colors of her embroidery,
that she had begun to wish Paul Verney
had at least a family tree if not a title. Money she
was not so particular about, as Lucie had plenty of
that. But he was only a sublieutenant and his
father was an advocate in a small way in a provincial
town. Madame Bernard groaned when she
thought of these last things.</p>

<p>When billiards was proposed, the old lady made
no objection whatever, but followed the two young
people into the large, cool billiard room with its
parquet floor and ground glass ceiling, and embroidered
industriously while the two played a
merry game and Lucie beat Paul two points to
one. She could beat him at billiards, at tennis,
and at cards; she sang and played much better
than he, and rode quite as well; and she delighted
in showing her skill over him; but, having a great
deal of sense in her pretty head, she realized that in
all considerable things Paul stood near the top. He
took his defeats so pleasantly, for he was the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>modest fellow alive, that Lucie often declared there
was no pleasure in beating him.</p>

<p>This particular afternoon Lucie beat him most
shamefully, but Paul had his reward in the enjoyment
of her exquisite grace in playing the most
graceful game in the world. Madame Bernard, apparently
absorbed in her embroidery, was watching
every tone and motion and saw that they were playing
another game far more interesting and with
much greater stakes than any game of billiards.
And, as she had a presentiment that Lucie would
have her own way in the matter of a husband, Madame
Bernard, with calm resignation, was quite
reconciled to Paul, and was glad in the present instance
it was no worse. They played through the
whole afternoon, and Madame Bernard asked Paul
to stay to dinner, but this he was obliged to decline,
much to his vexation. A sublieutenant of dragoons
is not master of his own time, so Paul went away
reluctantly, and was followed by the vision of a
charming figure, showing the most beautiful hand
and arm in the world, and dealing the most deadly
shots to her antagonist.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo10"><img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;Saw that they were playing another game far more interesting.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Saw that they were playing another game far more interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">When dinner was over, Lucie came and sat by
Madame Bernard in her own small drawing-room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>as the old lady stitched at her embroidery under
the evening lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama,&rdquo; she said quietly, after a long
pause, &ldquo;what do you think of Paul Verney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most estimable young man,&rdquo; replied Madame
Bernard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His family are not at all rich or distinguished,&rdquo;
said Lucie, &ldquo;but they are very dear. I wish you
could see his father, so kind, so pleasant, so gallant
toward Madame Verney, and like an older brother
to Paul. And Madame Verney is sweet&mdash;I love to
see them together, Paul and his father and mother.
And then they are so kind to poor Sophie and Captain
Ravenel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whenever Sophie Ravenel&rsquo;s name was mentioned,
it was like a knife to Madame Bernard&rsquo;s proud,
weak, sensitive heart. It was not only that Sophie&rsquo;s
conduct had been sinful, but, what was worse, it
was such bad form. Lucie meditated a while, and
then added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Paul is a poor man even for a sublieutenant,
and he will not have an easy time of it. He
has no family influence or powerful friends to push
him forward, and he will only get on by his own
merits. But that always tells in the long run.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>When Paul is forty, all his superiors will know
what a fine man and what a fine officer he is. He
will be given things for the asking, that other men
strive and struggle for. And he is not at all handsome,
though he looks well in uniform, and on horseback.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then a silence fell in the drawing-room. There
was not a sound, except the ticking of the gilt
clock. Lucie was sitting by the table, her elbows
upon it, her rounded chin in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Madame Bernard, &ldquo;why do you
call Monsieur Verney by his first name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Lucie, quite calmly, taking Madame
Bernard&rsquo;s embroidery out of her hands, and
looking her full in the face, &ldquo;because I love him.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2></div>

<p>Those pleasant days of late summer and early
autumn were a halcyon time to Paul and Lucie, and
to Toni and Denise. Toni was troubled with no
qualms, whatever, with regard to Denise&rsquo;s superiority
to him, and the fact that she might justly
aspire to something far beyond a private soldier.
He was the Toni of old, and, like the great Napoleon,
he reckoned that if he wanted a thing, it
was his already; and, instead of shrinking from the
idea of Denise&rsquo;s impressive fortune of ten thousand
francs, he was glad she had so much, and wished
that it was more&mdash;not that he meant to squander
it or that he loved Denise for it. He would have
loved her just as well without a franc. Nor did he
love her any better for having it, but he did not
consider that the ten thousand francs placed any
barrier between Denise and himself. And then from
the first moment their eyes had met on the night of
the ball in the public square, that old, sweet feeling
of being cared for and protected by Denise had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>stolen into his heart. Toni wanted a wife to protect
him from other people and from himself&mdash;that
was the long and short of it. As for Denise, her
nature had shaped itself to the idea of looking after
Toni and she wanted to give him all the buns and
good things in life. With Paul and Lucie this was
exactly reversed. Lucie felt the most charming
sense of protection in Paul&rsquo;s strong arm and strong
sense.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 308px;">
<a id="illo11"><img src="images/i_198.jpg" width="308" alt="Denise." title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">Denise.</p>

<p class="smgap">Toni courted Denise assiduously, and did the
same by Mademoiselle Duval and the sergeant, and
succeeded, in the course of time, in winning a
grudging respect from the sergeant. That stern
warrior knew too much about Toni&rsquo;s boyhood to
accept him at his own value, but his perfect knowledge
of the <i>voltige</i> was an irresistible recommendation
to the sergeant, and moreover, there was no
denying that Toni was a good soldier, attentive to
his duty. He had not once been punished since he
had joined; and this was a remarkable record even
for the best of soldiers. Then Toni stood well with
his sublieutenant. This counted for something
with the sergeant; nevertheless, he remembered how,
in the old days at Bienville, Toni&rsquo;s black shock and
Paul Verney&rsquo;s blond head were often close together,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>and these youthful friendships have a strong hold
on many men. Still, Paul Verney was not the man
to overlook the sins of a conscript, and the sergeant
was forced to admit that no fault could be found
with Toni so far.</p>

<p>He had begun by suspecting Toni&rsquo;s intentions
toward Denise, but his suspicions had been completely
lulled to sleep, chiefly by Denise herself.
This young person, who rarely raised her eyes from
the ground and might have posed for a statue of
Simplicity, knew perfectly well how to throw dust
in the sergeant&rsquo;s eyes. Concerning Toni, she never
allowed him to be mentioned without some disparaging
remark, such as, &ldquo;That ridiculous Toni,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;That absurd creature.&rdquo; She called attention to
the fact, which everybody knew, that Toni&rsquo;s nose
was a snub. She also observed, what nobody else
had, that Toni slouched when he walked and was
very ugly. Toni, in truth, was the most graceful
fellow in the regiment, and handsome in his black-eyed,
black-browed way. Denise would scarcely
admit that Toni knew how to ride, but even this did
not put the sergeant on his guard. She openly
complained that Toni did not know how to dance
and waltzed all over her feet when he danced with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>her in the evenings in the public square. When in
her father&rsquo;s presence, and Toni was there, Denise
treated him like a dog. He was the only person
living to whom she had ever shown any active hostility,
but the mild, the gentle Denise would take
him up on the smallest provocation, yawned at his
jokes, laughed when he told of his discomforts and
contradicted most of his assertions.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duval, who had become a great
friend of Toni&rsquo;s, lectured Denise on this, and even
the sergeant told her that he thought she was rather
hard on poor Toni. At this Denise shrugged her
shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s such a bore,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I always recollect
him as a dirty, greedy little boy at Bienville. I believe
he is just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Toni certainly showed neither of those
traits at present, but Denise would not allow a word
to be said in his favor. Toni, however, strange to
say, did not appear to be discomposed by this conduct
of Denise&rsquo;s, but joined the Duval party two or
three times a week when they sat, on the pleasant
evenings, in the public square listening to the
music; and invariably asked Denise to dance with
him. He even had the assurance, when it grew cool
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>in the autumn evenings, to come to their lodgings,
and it was here that Denise&rsquo;s neglect of him inspired
the sergeant to remonstrate with her.</p>

<p>Toni had the superlative impudence even to
bring an occasional bag of roasted chestnuts or
some little cakes to Denise, for Toni was a connoisseur
in cakes, but she invariably declared that
they were very bad of their kind. This same Denise,
when she and Toni danced together, would
whisper in his ear, &ldquo;Be sure and ask me to dance at
least twice more,&rdquo; or, tripping along the street,
would meet him and, lifting her pretty eyes to him,
would say, &ldquo;Toni, when are you coming to see us
again?&rdquo;&mdash;but such is the nature of woman.</p>

<p>Early in September Madame Marcel arranged
to come to pay Toni a visit, as Toni could not go
to see her, and Toni engaged a lodging for her in
the same house where Mademoiselle Duval and
Denise lodged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think, aunt?&rdquo; cried Denise, on
learning this from the landlady, &ldquo;that impudent
Toni has dared to engage a room for his mother on
the same floor with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sergeant happened to be present. He had
grateful recollections of Madame Marcel, the neat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>ness
of her shop and the thriving trade she had, as
well as that lady&rsquo;s personal charms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Denise,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you gibe at Toni entirely
too much, and as for his mother, a most estimable
woman is Madame Marcel, and an old friend and
neighbor, and I desire that you treat her with politeness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly I shall, papa,&rdquo; replied Denise, &ldquo;but
as for that odious Toni, you know I can&rsquo;t stand
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have to stand him,&rdquo; replied the sergeant
tartly. &ldquo;He is a good soldier and seems to
have reformed completely, and you must show him
some respect while his mother is here at least. Do
you understand me, Denise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Denise understood him perfectly, only the sergeant
did not in the least understand Denise.</p>

<p>It was on an early autumn afternoon that Toni
met his mother in the third-class waiting-room
at the station. When he took her in his arms he
felt himself a little boy again. Madame Marcel
was not much changed, except that her hair, of a
satin blackness like Toni&rsquo;s when he had last seen
her, was now amply streaked with gray.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mama, Mama!&rdquo; cried Toni, kissing her, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>the big tears ran down his cheeks, &ldquo;your hair is
gray and it is I who have done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Toni,&rdquo; cried Madame Marcel, who was
kissing him all over his face, and, who, like most
mothers, was unwilling to admit that the prodigal
had been at fault, &ldquo;your mother is growing old, my
son; that is it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was still handsome, though, and very well
dressed in her black bonnet and silk mantle, and
looked quite the lady. Toni felt proud of her as he
escorted her through the street, carrying her bags
and parcels on his arm; and Madame Marcel felt
proud of her handsome young soldier with his trim
uniform, for Toni, under the guidance and recommendation
of his corporal, had developed into a
model of soldierly smartness in dress. Toni showed
his mother up stairs into the neat room he had engaged
for her, and Madame Marcel stowed away
the provisions she had brought for herself and
Toni, being a thoughtful soul. Then Toni sat in
his mother&rsquo;s lap, as he had done when he was a
little boy, and told her everything that had happened
to him, except about Nicolas and Pierre.
He was trying to oust those two villains from his
mind and to shut the door on that terrible secret
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>that he shared with them. He told his mother about
Denise and Mademoiselle Duval; and Madame Marcel,
knowing Denise to be the most correct of young
girls, with ten thousand francs as her fortune, rejoiced
that Toni had fallen in love with her, for it
was clearly impossible that Denise, or any other
girl, could resist her Toni, now that he was clean
and was doing his duty.</p>

<p>After a while, a tap came at the door, and when
Toni opened it, there stood the sergeant, got up as
if he were on dress parade under the eye of the
general himself, his mustaches beautifully waxed,
not only waxed but flagrantly dyed a shining black.
He greeted Madame Marcel with effusion, and then
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to request that Madame Marcel will have
supper with us to-night. She has not yet made her
arrangements, perhaps, and my sister and my
daughter will be most pleased. I am sorry, Toni,
that I can not ask you, but you are due at the barracks.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 312px;">
<a id="illo12"><img src="images/i_204.jpg" width="308" alt="&ldquo;The sergeant, got up as if he were on dress parade.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;The sergeant, got up as if he were on dress parade.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">It struck Toni that this was a scheme for getting
him out of the way. He saw something in the sergeant&rsquo;s
eye which indicated a very deep interest in
Madame Marcel, and then recollection came sur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>ging
over Toni of the proposition which the sergeant
had made some few years before, to marry
Madame Marcel for the purpose of thrashing the
little boy who hid trembling under the counter.
Toni was too big to thrash now, but the sergeant
always appeared to him to be about nine feet high.
Toni did not approve of the match in the concrete,
but in the abstract, as the sergeant&rsquo;s advances
to Madame Marcel might result to the advantage
of Toni and Denise, Toni determined to encourage
him. He felt sure that his mother, like most mothers,
was more in love with him than with any other
man, and would hardly dare jilt him for the finest
sergeant in the French army. So Toni, on his way
to the barracks, turned over things in his mind, and
determined to forward the sergeant&rsquo;s suit up to a
certain point.</p>

<p>Things turned out very much as Toni had anticipated.
The sergeant had reached that time of
life when he began to look forward to his retirement.
He had saved up something and, by his
sister&rsquo;s thrift and generosity, Denise was provided
for, but the idea of Madame Marcel&rsquo;s large, warm,
cheerful kitchen in winter, and shady garden in
summer would be extremely attractive to a retired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>sergeant on half-pay. And Madame Marcel was
extremely comely, there was no doubt about that,
and not given to scolding like Mademoiselle Duval.</p>

<p>As for Madame Marcel, she saw through the sergeant
in forty-eight hours, and what she did not
see Toni enlightened her upon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mama,&rdquo; said he, some days after, when the two
were in the privacy of Madame Marcel&rsquo;s room, &ldquo;I
think Sergeant Duval wants to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For answer, Madame Marcel blushed up to her
eyes and replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For shame, Toni. I have no idea of marrying
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you had,&rdquo; replied the wily Toni.
&ldquo;I said the sergeant wants to marry you, or,
rather, I think he wants to marry the shop. But he
doesn&rsquo;t want to marry me&mdash;I am too big to thrash.
But, Mama,&rdquo; he continued, coming up to her and
putting his arm around her waist, a species of love-making
which mothers adore, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t throw
the sergeant down too hard; at least, not for the
present; because I&mdash;I&rdquo;&mdash;here Toni blushed more
than his mother and grinned bashfully, &ldquo;because
I want to marry Denise. I never told you this before.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There was no need to, Toni,&rdquo; replied his
mother, laughing, &ldquo;I have seen it ever since you
were ten years old, and I think Denise wants to
marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this Toni&rsquo;s black eyes danced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think so, too,&rdquo; he said, with his own inimitable
na&iuml;vete. &ldquo;For all she is so bashful she has told me
so a great many times, with her eyes, that is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it would be an excellent match for you,
Toni,&rdquo; replied his mother. &ldquo;Denise is so orderly,
so neat, and such a good manager, and after you
have served your term and come back to Bienville,
I will take you and Denise with me into the shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can do better than that,&rdquo; cried Toni. &ldquo;I can
be instructor in a riding-school and get three hundred
francs the month, and then you can sell the
shop and come and live with Denise and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Marcel was too sensible a woman to accept
this arrangement beforehand, but replied prudently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, if you can make three hundred francs
the month, you and Denise can go and live in Paris
and I will visit you twice a year, it would hardly
be safe for me to give up the shop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we should be afraid to leave you there,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>said Toni roguishly, chucking his mother under
the chin, &ldquo;with the sergeant just across the way,
for he will be retired just as my time is up. You
and he might elope some fine day, and then come
and fall down on your knees and humbly beg my
pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly shall if I elope,&rdquo; replied Madame
Marcel, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sergeant is hard hit,&rdquo; continued Toni.
&ldquo;Let me see, you had supper with them the evening
you came&mdash;that was Thursday. Then, the next
morning the sergeant sent you in a melon for your
breakfast, and in the afternoon, when you were sitting
in the public square, he joined you. I saw him
sitting on the bench beside you, but he sneaked off
as soon as he saw me coming&mdash;that was Friday.
Then Friday evening he put Denise up to asking
you to take a walk, and you fell in with him, so
Denise tells me, and he walked home with you. And
to-day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then, a tap came at the door, and the sergeant,
with his beautifully waxed and dyed mustaches
appeared. He carried in his hand a large
nosegay, and without seeing Toni, bowed low to
Madame Marcel and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, will you honor me by accepting this
little offering?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Marcel advanced, smiling, and accepted
the nosegay shyly. Toni, meanwhile, had slipped
behind a screen which concealed the stove.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very charming you are looking to-day,
Madame. No one would dream that you had a son
as old as Toni. You should represent him as your
younger brother,&rdquo; said the sergeant gallantly and
quite unaware of Toni behind the screen.</p>

<p>For all Madame Marcel declared she never
meant to marry again, nevertheless, she was a woman,
and the sergeant&rsquo;s compliments tickled her
agreeably, so she smiled coyly at this and declared
she looked a hundred.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; cried the sergeant, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t look
more than twenty-five. And, by the way, Madame,
my sister and my daughter are making up a party
for to-morrow&mdash;I am off duty for the whole afternoon&mdash;and
we should be very much pleased if you
would join us in a little excursion by the tramway
to a very pleasant place about two miles from here,
in the country. There is an inn with a garden, and
we can take our luncheon with us and order the wine
from the inn. We shall start at five o&rsquo;clock, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>we shall hope to have the pleasure of your charming
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was too much for Toni. He suddenly
emerged from behind the screen and said, grasping
the sergeant&rsquo;s hand with effusion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, Sergeant, so much. We
will accept with pleasure. I think I can get off,
too, by applying to Lieutenant Verney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sergeant scowled at Toni. Here was a
pretty kettle of fish. He had no notion of having
him with their party, but there was now no help
for it. The prospect was charming for Toni. The
sergeant, he felt sure, would devote himself to Madame
Marcel, and then Toni and Denise would be
left to themselves&mdash;only, what was to become of
Mademoiselle Duval? Toni knew the Golden Lion
well, also its garden, and orchard, and it was full
of little sequestered places where he might have a
quiet word with Denise except for Mademoiselle
Duval. But Toni was a strategist of no mean order,
and if he once got Denise in the garden of the
Golden Lion he thought he could see her for a few
minutes alone. So the party was made up for the
next day if the weather should permit. Toni, too,
could get off after parade, which was at four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>o&rsquo;clock, and everything seemed most auspicious, except
concerning Mademoiselle Duval.</p>

<p>As Toni walked his beat that night, for he was
doing sentry duty, he began to turn over in his
mind various plans by which he could get rid of his
prospective aunt-in-law, and suddenly a brilliant
idea came to him. He knew Mademoiselle Duval
was mortally afraid of snakes. It is true it was
hardly the season for snakes, being the middle of
September, but this would make no difference to
Mademoiselle Duval, who shuddered even in January
at the thought of a snake. Toni, therefore, laid
his plans, and the next morning he contrived to get
off for an hour and went to Mademoiselle Duval&rsquo;s
lodgings.</p>

<p>Denise was out, and Mademoiselle Duval was
reading the weekly religious newspaper, which was
her sole literary recreation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Toni, in a low voice, so that
his mother, on the same floor, might not hear him,
&ldquo;this afternoon, I believe, we are all to go for an
excursion to the Golden Lion and have tea in the
garden. I want to ask you, as a favor, not to mention
to my mother that the place is full of snakes
of all sorts. I have been there often, and I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>never gone in my life that I did not see a snake,
and sometimes half a dozen, in that garden. They
are not at all dangerous, but if my mother saw one
it would alarm her so much, and I don&rsquo;t wish her to
know that there are any to be seen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw&mdash;aw&mdash;aw!&rdquo; Mademoiselle Duval shrieked.
&ldquo;You may take your mother if you like, Toni, but
nothing on earth would induce me to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni could have hugged her on the spot, but he
began to urge her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, Mademoiselle, don&rsquo;t think of remaining
behind. The snakes are perfectly harmless, I assure
you. Most of them are the little green garter
snakes that are as harmless as the garter you wear
around your leg.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech caused Mademoiselle Duval to blush,
and she said sternly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni, your language and allusion are most improper.
At all events, I am resolved not to go to
the Golden Lion this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will annoy the sergeant very much if you
don&rsquo;t go, and if he knows that it is on account of
a few little garter snakes he will laugh at you for
the rest of your life, particularly as it is now September
and they are not very active.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My brother may laugh at me as much as he
likes,&rdquo; replied Mademoiselle Duval, privately resolving
not to give the sergeant the chance. &ldquo;I simply
shall not go. Perhaps I may make some excuse
to keep my brother and Denise from urging me, but
I shall not go&mdash;of that you may be sure&mdash;and I
think you are a most undutiful son to take your
mother to any such place. As for my brother and
Denise, they go about as if there were no such
things as snakes in the world.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2></div>

<p>Toni returned to the barracks confident of victory,
and was not at all surprised when, at five
o&rsquo;clock, he met his mother and the sergeant and
Denise at the tram station, to find that Mademoiselle
Duval had a raging headache and was
compelled to remain at home. The sergeant, too,
rather liked the arrangement, except that he was
afraid that Denise would not be sufficiently polite
to Toni. So, on their way to the rendezvous he had
warned her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Denise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you running
away from Toni and treating him like a dog
before his mother this afternoon. You have got to
be civil to him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; answered Denise, with the air of
a martyr, &ldquo;I suppose I shall have to be civil to him
before his mother, but Toni really bores me dreadfully.&rdquo;
Oh! Denise, what a story-teller you are!</p>

<p>When they got on the tram it was so crowded
that it was impossible for the party to get seats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>together, so Denise, making a pretty grimace on the
sly at her father, went and sat with Toni quite at
the end of the car, and out of sight of her father
and Toni&rsquo;s mother, and her first speech, whispered
softly in his ear, was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Toni, how nice it is to be together like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni answered not one word, but he looked at
Denise with his whole soul shining out of his lustrous
black eyes, and Denise thought him the finest
young soldier in the world.</p>

<p>It was a warm September afternoon, and their
road lay through the beautiful valley of the Seine.
There were many family parties on the tram, and
when they reached the Golden Lion the large garden
and even the orchard beyond were full of tables
at which people were eating and drinking.
There were plenty of soldiers about, and some of
Toni&rsquo;s comrades would have been very much pleased
at an introduction to the sergeant&rsquo;s pretty daughter,
but the sergeant would not oblige them, neither
would Toni. The party seated themselves at a table
under an acacia tree, which reminded Toni and
Denise of that other acacia tree at Bienville under
which they had sat and munched and loved in their
childhood. Madame Marcel unpacked their lunch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>basket and they ordered wine and tea from the inn
and proceeded to enjoy themselves. Under the combined
influence of wine and woman the sergeant
grew positively lover-like, and, when their tea was
over and they got up to walk about the garden,
he very soon managed to have Madame Marcel to
himself. He was quite unconscious of being assisted
in his man&oelig;uvers by Toni and Denise and Madame
herself, who had a very good mind to give Toni all
possible chances with Denise and her ten thousand
francs. So presently Toni found himself alone
with Denise in a little nook in the orchard, behind
a great clump of dwarf plum trees. The soft light
of evening was about them, the air was hushed and
the stillness was only broken by the faint and distant
sounds of merriment. All the world seemed
fair and beautiful and peaceful, and the fairest
thing of all to Toni was the blue heaven of Denise&rsquo;s
eyes. She wore a pretty blue gown, and a jaunty
black hat upon her blond hair. Her eyes, which
were as blue as her gown, were usually downcast,
but were now upturned to Toni quite frankly. She
had loved Toni as long as he had loved her&mdash;indeed,
the world without Toni had seemed to her quite an
impossible place. He said softly to her:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Denise, in all those seven years that I did not
see you did you ever think of me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Denise. She said this with a simple
sincerity that went to Toni&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know every time I wrote to my mother I
always put the most important line at the bottom&mdash;my
love to D. She knew what I meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Denise, with a little gasp of pleasure,
&ldquo;she always gave me your message.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always felt that sometime or other we should
be Denise and Toni as we had been when you were
a dear little girl and I was a dirty bad little boy.
And Denise, I swear to you, whatever I have done
wrong in my life, I have been true to you. I never
told any other girl that I loved her, because I never
loved any other girl. I took my fling with them,
but in every girl I ever saw in my life it seemed to
me that I saw something of you, Denise. You need
not think that women in the circus are bad just because
they are in the circus. There are plenty of
them that are just as good in their way as&mdash;as
Mademoiselle Duval is in hers. They don&rsquo;t take a
religious newspaper, but they stand by each other
in their troubles. They help with each other&rsquo;s children
and when a woman&rsquo;s husband gives her a black
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>eye all the other women fly at him and help to
abuse him. Oh, Denise, I think women are very
good, and the worst of them is too good for the best
of men. Denise, I am not half good enough for
you, but I want you to marry me as soon as my time
is up. I can get off with one year&rsquo;s service if I
escape punishments, and that I have done and mean
to do, for your sake, Denise.&rdquo; He took Denise&rsquo;s
hand in his&mdash;their eyes met and then their lips.
A bird in the plum tree above began cooing softly
to its mate. The bird seemed, like Toni and Denise,
to think the earth was Heaven.</p>

<p>Their love-making was very simple, as were their
natures and their lives; they were only a private
soldier and a sergeant&rsquo;s daughter, but they loved
each other well and asked nothing better of life
than love.</p>

<p>Meanwhile things had not been progressing so
favorably with Sergeant Duval and Madame Marcel.
The sergeant had been a little too vigorous
in his wooing and Madame Marcel, who simply had
Toni&rsquo;s advantage in view, felt called on to repress
her lover. The sergeant, who had a big voice
in his big frame, had made his wishes concerning
his future with Madame Marcel quite audible to all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>the people surrounding them. Everybody had
heard him say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Madame, you should think of changing
your condition, really. The cares of your shop
are too many for you&mdash;a great deal too many.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have managed them for the past twenty
years,&rdquo; replied Madame Marcel, who thought herself
better qualified to keep a candy shop than the
sergeant was, and who understood perfectly what
the sergeant was driving at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the sergeant, floundering a little,
&ldquo;but a woman should not stand alone&mdash;she is not
able to do it&mdash;that&rsquo;s the truth. She is being taken
advantage of at every turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And sometimes,&rdquo; calmly responded Madame
Marcel, &ldquo;the advantage is on her side. I have managed,
during my twenty years of widowhood to accumulate
a competence. Toni will not be badly off
when I die, and when he marries I mean to make him
an allowance equal to the income from his wife&rsquo;s
dowry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This seemed sinful waste to the sergeant, who
thought Toni did not deserve such generosity.
That superfluity of which Madame Marcel spoke
he considered had much better be expended on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>worthy veteran who had served his country for more
than thirty years, and who would like extremely
to end his days in affluence. But it was plain that
Madame Marcel had the best of him in the argument
that a woman could not take care of herself,
so the sergeant changed his tactics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it would be so much more comfortable for
you, Madame, to have a protector&mdash;a husband I
mean. Toni will get married and go off, and that
will be the end of him.&rdquo; The sergeant snapped his
fingers. &ldquo;But a kind and affectionate husband, a
man of steady habits&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most men of bad habits are very steady in those
habits,&rdquo; replied Madame Marcel. She was not a
satirist and her remark was the more telling because
of her sincerity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right, Madame, but I mean a man of
good habits, a man who doesn&rsquo;t spend most of his
time at the wine shops, who has some domestic virtues.
I believe, Madame, that the non-commissioned
officers in the French army are the finest body of
men in the world for domestic life. I never knew a
sergeant, or a corporal either for that matter, who
was not a good husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I couldn&rsquo;t go amiss if I should take any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>one of them,&rdquo; answered Madame Marcel demurely.
&ldquo;There is a very nice man, a corporal lately retired,
who has bought out the cigar shop near me at
Bienville. Gossip has linked our names together,
but I had not thought of marrying him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By no means should you marry him,&rdquo; cried the
sergeant, realizing that he had been too general in
his commendations. &ldquo;He is probably after your
shop and after that nice little competence, which,
I judge from your words, you have accumulated.
No, Madame, you could aspire to a sergeant&mdash;it
would be sinful to throw yourself away on a corporal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Marcel smiled mysteriously, but a good
many of the listeners smiled quite openly, particularly
a party of soldiers near them. One of them
behind Madame Marcel&rsquo;s back undertook to enact
the part of Madame Marcel while his comrade,
mimicking every action of the sergeant&rsquo;s, managed
to convulse all who observed him as he followed this
love scene. The sergeant folded his arms, twirled
his dyed mustaches, and reflected. He had not
made a single breach in the defense as yet. He had
heard that women were easily made jealous, so he
concluded to try it as a <i>ruse de guerre</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have concluded at
the end of my present term of enlistment to marry
and settle down. I may say to you, Madame, in
strict confidence, that I have considered the charms
of Mademoiselle Dumont, the dressmaker, whose
establishment is a short way from yours, Madame,
at Bienville. She is a most estimable woman, of a
suitable age, and has given me some marks of encouragement&mdash;in
fact, I believe it was generally
thought among our acquaintances, at the time of
my last visit to Bienville, that I should have proposed
to Mademoiselle Dumont before I left. My
attentions, I admit, had been somewhat compromising.
I had sent her a large basket of figs, and, one
day, when I went fishing, I also sent her my whole
catch, besides having taken her and her sister on an
excursion into the country, and having entertained
them handsomely. I thought, when I saw Mademoiselle
Dumont for the last time, that she seemed
a little piqued, and I have reason to know that she
reckons herself rather ill-treated by me; but it is
by no means unlikely that on my return next summer
I shall offer my hand to Mademoiselle Dumont.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you have not heard,&rdquo; remarked Ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>dame
Marcel sweetly, &ldquo;that Mademoiselle Dumont
was married about two months ago to Hermann, the
Swiss violinist, who taught Toni to play the violin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a facer for the sergeant, but he carried
it off better than could be expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So she married Hermann, the fiddler?&mdash;a Swiss
fiddler! Then she was more chagrined than I supposed.
I suspected she would do something rash if I
went away without proposing. Poor, poor creature!
As for Hermann&rsquo;s teaching your Toni to play the
violin, why Madame, Toni could no more play the
fiddle than he can command the regiment. Very
well! Mademoiselle Dumont would have been no
match for a sergeant. I am glad now that I did
not propose to her, as she certainly expected me to
do. She is much better matched with a Swiss fiddler
than with a sergeant who has seen service for
more than thirty years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sergeant eyed Madame Marcel closely. Was
it possible that this demure and correct person, in
her neat black bonnet and graceful mantle, was
poking fun at him?&mdash;Sergeant Duval, of the
dragoons! But Madame Marcel looked so innocent
that it was impossible to fathom her; and just then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>Toni and Denise appeared on the scene. The instant
Madame Marcel&rsquo;s maternal eye fell upon
Toni, she knew that something had happened, and
that that something was good. And presently it
was time to go home, and they all journeyed back to
Beaupr&eacute;. They walked to their lodgings together
through the soft purple twilight of September.
Toni went with his mother to her room, and, taking
her in his arms, poured out his heart to her. His
mother kissed him and shed a few tears as mothers
will do under those circumstances. And then
Toni had to run for the barracks as hard as he
could.</p>

<p>About nine o&rsquo;clock, when he was through with
his stable work and was standing in the barrack
square, he saw Paul Verney passing by. Toni stood
at attention, with such a look on his face that Paul
Verney stopped and spoke to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you want, <i>mon enfant</i>?&rdquo; he said, after
that pleasant form of address with which the officers
speak to their soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see you, sir, in private, for a little while,&rdquo;
answered Toni under his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, come to my quarters at half-past
nine.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo13"><img src="images/i_224.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;Was it possible that this demure and correct person ... was
poking fun at him?&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Was it possible that this demure and correct person ... was
poking fun at him?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p class="smgap">So at half-past nine Toni presented himself at
Paul&rsquo;s quarters. It never seemed to them to be
at all strange that Paul should be sitting at his
ease, smoking, in the chair before his writing-desk,
while Toni stood stiffly at attention. The sympathy
which bound them was too close for those trifling
distinctions to count, and between the officer sitting
and the soldier standing it was still Paul and Toni
in private. Paul was smoking now, and on his desk,
under the green-shaded lamp, lay a pretty little
note. He was composing an answer to it with as
much care and precision as if it were a report to the
Minister of War. The light of the lamp fell on
his blond head and fairish complexion.</p>

<p>As Paul looked at Toni, he could not but think
how Toni was improved by being made into a
soldier. He was certainly the best looking young
fellow in Paul&rsquo;s troop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Toni,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;out with it. I saw
you on the tram to-day with Denise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni turned red under his tan and sunburn.
His mouth came open in a delighted grin, showing
every one of the large, white teeth. He brought his
straight, black brows together and said, in that tone
of intimacy which carried the officer and the sol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>dier
back to the days when they belonged to the
great democracy of boys and huddled together in
the nook on the old bridge at Bienville:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Denise loves me.&rdquo; He did not think it necessary
to say how much he loved Denise. Paul rose,
and, putting both hands on Toni&rsquo;s shoulders, gave
him a vigorous shake of affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am deuced glad to hear it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t behave yourself to that sweet girl after you
are married I promise you the handsomest drubbing
you ever had in your life. What do you think the
sergeant will say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God knows!&rdquo; said Toni, dolefully shaking his
head. &ldquo;I think he wants to marry my mother, or
marry the shop, that is. You see his term is up,
sir, next year. But I don&rsquo;t think my mother wants
to marry him or anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But would it be a good thing if the sergeant
thought it would help his chances with your mother
if he agreed to let you have Denise?&rdquo; asked Paul,
who was usually the soul of candor, but who, like
all men, was Machiavellian in love matters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That it would, sir,&rdquo; answered Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Paul, grinning sympathetically
at Toni, &ldquo;I shall speak to the sergeant myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>about you. Unluckily the sergeant knows us both
too well&mdash;he used to see us when we were boys together
at Bienville. Still, you have been a good soldier,
Toni, and I don&rsquo;t think anything can be said
against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except&mdash;except&mdash;&rdquo; here Toni&rsquo;s eyes grew wide
and bright with fear, &ldquo;except about Nicolas and
Pierre.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope we shall never see or hear anything more
of those two rapscallions again,&rdquo; replied Paul,
&ldquo;and, at all events, it is not worth while to say anything
about that part of your life. Toni, you are,
in some respects, the greatest coward I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; answered Toni frankly. &ldquo;I always
was, you remember. I can&rsquo;t help it. But, at least,
I am not afraid of horses, nor of guns, nor of fighting,
if an officer will only stand by me and look at
me very hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul sat down at the desk and fingered the little
note to which he was composing a reply. He began
to reflect how much better off Toni was than himself.
Toni was not held back from the girl of his
choice by any consciousness of inequality in worldly
position, although a girl of Denise&rsquo;s beauty, merit
and fortune might certainly look higher than Toni.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>But Lucie Bernard&mdash;when Paul thought of her
millions of francs, her beauty, and then saw himself,
a sublieutenant of dragoons, the son of a middle-class
advocate at Bienville, his heart was like lead in
his breast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni,&rdquo; said he presently, &ldquo;do you remember
how Mademoiselle Lucie Bernard used to look in the
old days at Bienville?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; cried Toni. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I remember
the day that she talked with you in the park when
I showed you where she was, and when Madame
Ravenel fainted, didn&rsquo;t I tell you so you could
bring the water in your cap? Oh, I remember
Mademoiselle Lucie well. She was the prettiest little
lady and she is just the same now. I have seen
her several times since I have been here and she always
smiles and nods at me so sweetly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul could not confide so frankly in Toni as
Toni had confided in him, but, nevertheless, they
understood each other without any more words.
Paul sat and frowned and looked at his note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Toni,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this world is full of thorns
for a sublieutenant of dragoons without any fortune.
You may go now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni went toward the door but paused, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>knob in his hand. &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;you
will soon be as happy as I am,&rdquo; and then he vanished
through the door and went clattering down
the corridor.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2></div>

<p>After Toni had gone, Paul smoked and looked
for a long time at the pretty little note. He got one
almost every day. Lucie wished him to come to
dinner, or to ride with her, or to send her a book, or
to do something which was an excuse to get Paul
to the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard.</p>

<p>And it was impossible that Madame Bernard
should not know of all this; but Paul remembered,
with a groan, that Lucie had always been able
to wrap that imposing-looking person around her
little finger. And would it be right&mdash;would it be
a manly thing&mdash;for a poor sublieutenant of
dragoons to take advantage of this childish fancy?
Paul, resting his blond head in both his hands,
remembered that sometimes these youthful attachments,
which begin, as it were, with one&rsquo;s first look
at life, last throughout the whole play until the
curtain goes down at the end. This puzzled him
still more, and he suddenly thrust Lucie&rsquo;s letter,
and her sweet image, and Toni, and Bienville and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>the whole business out of his head, and, taking up
a book on Strategy, studied until midnight.</p>

<p>The note from Lucie was to ask him to ride with
her the next afternoon as she had a new horse and
Madame Bernard was not quite willing to trust her
alone with a groom. No French girl would have
sent such an invitation, but Lucie had acquired,
during her two years in America, all the directness,
the habit of command, the insight into a man&rsquo;s
mind of an American girl. Among the number of
things which amazed but charmed Paul was the
astonishing invention Lucie displayed in bringing
Paul to her side. Of course, there was nothing for
him to do but to accept this invitation to protect
Lucie&rsquo;s life, so the next afternoon they were cantering
gaily through the park toward the highroad,
with a groom in attendance. As they passed
the place where Count Delorme&rsquo;s body had been
found, Lucie turned her head away with something
like a shudder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always hated him,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;until he was
killed, but you can&rsquo;t hate a dead man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hate a scoundrel dead or alive,&rdquo; replied
Paul stoutly. &ldquo;He ruined your sister&rsquo;s young life,
he deserved to die a bad death.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Sophie&rsquo;s life is quite ruined,&rdquo; said
Lucie.</p>

<p>They had brought their horses down to a walk
and the groom, who had neither eyes nor ears, had
fallen a little way behind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sophie is married to the man she loves&mdash;I am
sure she would not change Captain Ravenel for a
Marshal of France if she could get him. She has
had great sorrows, but she has had great happiness,
too. I know perfectly well what Sophie did, and
it was not right, but she was cruelly punished for
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul, who was thoroughly French in his ideas of
young ladies, was much scandalized at this speech
of Lucie&rsquo;s, but Lucie was more American than
French, and Paul knew the limpid innocence of her
mind. Still he thought that Lucie should be more
guarded in her speech, and thought that if he had
the rare good fortune of marrying her, he would
make her a little more prudent.</p>

<p>They soon struck the highroad and presently
were passing through a forest which was intersected
by many roads. A crackling of shots was heard in
the distance&mdash;the troopers were practising at the
rifle butts. Paul turned to the groom and told him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>to ride forward and find out where the butts were,
and just then Toni appeared. Saluting Paul, Toni
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon, sir, but the orders are that no one shall
be allowed to cross this road, and you will have to
remain sir, if you please, on this side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But this lady&rsquo;s groom is on the other side. He
will be back presently,&rdquo; urged Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very sorry, sir,&rdquo; said Toni, with an air of polite
determination, &ldquo;but those are the orders,&rdquo; and
then Paul and Toni saluted gravely, and Toni
backed off.</p>

<p>This meant that Paul and Lucie would have to
take their ride alone through the woods. Paul
turned to Lucie and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, Mademoiselle, how it is&mdash;it can not be
helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I am sure I don&rsquo;t wish it to be helped,&rdquo; responded
Lucie, in that daredevil American manner
of hers which shocked and charmed Paul. &ldquo;Now
we can talk freely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was, however, a road by which they could
get back to the highway, and along this they rode
in the bright autumn afternoon. Presently they
came to a rivulet into which a little spring bubbled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>They stopped to let the horses drink, and when they
were on the other side Lucie suddenly raised up and
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want some water, too,&rdquo; and before Paul could
say a word she had slid off her horse and, gathering
up the skirt to her habit, ran to the spring.
She pulled off her gloves, and dipping up the water
in the hollow of her little hand, pretended to drink
it, while it splashed all over her fresh, fair face.
Paul swung himself off his horse, and, leaning up
against a tree, watched Lucie with adoration in his
eyes. She had the unconscious grace of a child,
but Lucie was no child&mdash;she was a woman of gentle,
yet fixed resolve, of strong and tender feelings.
She was in love with Paul and had been ever since
she took his English book away from him that
summer afternoon in the park at Bienville so many
years ago; and reading Paul&rsquo;s mind, as she had
read that English book, she saw exactly what was
in it,&mdash;that he was in love with her and withheld by
pride, diffidence and generosity, all three excellent
qualities in a man&rsquo;s love. And Lucie, having much
practical American sense in her charming head, had
realized that an heiress has to be very prudent in
the man she marries, and that of all who professed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>to love her, Paul was the only one who loved her
well and would not tell her of it.</p>

<p>She looked at him, her face dimpling with laughter.
He was such a great goose, standing there,
his eyes devouring her, and gnawing his mustache
for fear the words would come out that he wished
to hold in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; she said, in a soft little voice, and Paul,
against his will, was forced to respond, &ldquo;Lucie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said Lucie. Paul came&mdash;he could
no more have held back than he could have stopped
breathing. &ldquo;Lend me your handkerchief.&rdquo; Paul
look his handkerchief out and Lucie wiped her
hands upon it, and then, without so much as saying,
&ldquo;By your leave,&rdquo; stuck it back in the breast
of his coat. This Paul thought delightful, but it
was not propriety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; said Lucie, &ldquo;suppose war were raging
now and you knew there would be a desperate battle
to-morrow, what would you say to me now, if
you thought this were the very last interview we
were to have before you went out on the firing
line?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul Verney was a man, after all, and his reply
to this was very obvious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say, &lsquo;Lucie, I love you,&rsquo;&rdquo; he replied,
holding out his hand in which Lucie put hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven,&rdquo; cried Lucie, &ldquo;at last! I would
have proposed to you long before if you had given
me the least encouragement, for I made up my mind
to marry you just as soon as you made up your
mind that you loved me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was laughing, but her eyes were dark with
feeling and bright with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not asked you to marry me,&rdquo; whispered
Paul, his voice trembling a little. &ldquo;I told you I
loved you&mdash;no man ever loved a woman more than I
love you&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think that I am any match
for you, Lucie, and it never seemed to me quite
right that I should take advantage of all the childish
things you said to me when we were boy and
girl, or of your rashness and imprudence now, for
Lucie, you are a very rash and imprudent girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the most prudent person living,&rdquo; whispered
Lucie, sidling up to him. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to be
married for my money and you are the only man I
know who would marry me quicker without my fortune
than with it&mdash;so Paul&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul made one last hopeless and quite desperate
stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lucie,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a villain I am ever to
have gone near you after I saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you saw it, did you?&rdquo; said Lucie, smiling,
but still trembling. &ldquo;Everybody else saw it&mdash;the
groom knows it, actually&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite ridiculous&rdquo;&mdash;and
then Paul surrendered. A sudden revelation
came to him from Lucie&rsquo;s eyes that his two thousand
francs a year mattered no more than her millions&mdash;that
it was not a question of francs, but of
the great master passion, which, when it enters
lordly into the abode of a man&rsquo;s or a woman&rsquo;s heart,
drives out everything else and reigns supreme.</p>

<p>They sat on a fallen tree and talked in whispers,
those echoes of the heart, until the shadows grew
long, and it was Lucie who had to remind Paul that
it was time to go home. The horses, which had
stood still meanwhile, cocked their ears knowingly
at Paul when he swung Lucie into her saddle. They
never saw the belated groom at all, nor cared what
had become of him as they rode back through the
dying glow of the autumn afternoon to the Ch&acirc;teau
Bernard. Lucie ran up the stone steps of the
ch&acirc;teau, followed by Paul. At the prospect of meeting
Madame Bernard, this dashing young sublieutenant
of dragoons felt as hopeless and helpless as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>a drenched hen. It was one thing to tell Lucie of
his love in the forest glade, to the music of the
silvery rippling spring, with the red sun making a
somber glory all around them and with no one except
the horses to listen, but to tell the chatelaine of
the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard about his two thousand francs
the year was almost more than Paul could stand.
Lucie led the way into Madame Bernard&rsquo;s little
drawing-room. A wood fire was crackling on the
hearth, for the evening had grown chilly, and Madame
Bernard, stately and timid, imposing and
nervous, with her everlasting embroidery, sat by
the table on which stood candles in tall silver candlesticks.
Lucie went up and, putting her arm around
the neck of the fierce-eyed and craven-hearted old
lady, and seating herself on the arm of the chair,
tipped the handsome old face up and kissed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grandmama,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have proposed and
have been accepted. Paul says he will marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul glared at Lucie. She was such an unconscionable
joker. He came forward, however, and
said in his best manner, which was a very fine manner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame, it is I who proposed to Mademoiselle
Lucie. If I did not love her so much I should apolo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>gize
for it, because I feel that she is entitled to more
of birth and of fortune and of rank than I can give
her. But I can give her more devotion and loyalty
than any other man living&mdash;of that I feel sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul fully expected Madame Bernard to box his
ears and call a footman to throw him out of the
house, but Madame Bernard did nothing of the sort.
She sighed a little and looked at Paul. She would
have liked a duke, at least, for Lucie&mdash;she had got a
count for Sophie, but how wretchedly had that
match turned out. The habit of obedience was
strong upon Madame Bernard, and Lucie was of a
nature so willing to take responsibility for herself
that it was always difficult to take responsibility for
her. Madame Bernard knew she was helpless, but,
as Paul had done, she made a feint of resistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, Monsieur,&rdquo; she said in a voice and
manner which she vainly tried to make commanding,
&ldquo;in the event this marriage comes off I shall
expect you to resign from the army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul turned pale. This thought had never occurred
to him before. Resign from the army! And
become gentleman usher to a rich wife! Never!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have little to offer Mademoiselle
Lucie, and the best thing, in a worldly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>point of view, is the career that I hope to make
in my profession. That, I may say, if you will
permit me, will not be unworthy of Mademoiselle
Lucie&rsquo;s acceptance, I trust.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Paul,&rdquo; cried Lucie, &ldquo;what you
say is quite right, and, grandmama, you might as
well make up your mind to it. When Paul and I
are married I shall have to live in all sorts of dull
little towns and poky little holes and perhaps go
to Algiers. I shall have to do just what any other
sublieutenant&rsquo;s wife has to do, and I shall like it
above all things. It will be like a masquerade, for
we shall know when Paul is a lieutenant-colonel,
then we can live handsomely and enjoy our money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucie&rsquo;s quick and comprehensive mind had already
gone forward and spanned the gulf between
a sublieutenant and a lieutenant-colonel. Madame
Bernard sighed again. All womanly women are
natural romancers and love a lover, and she did not
think less of Paul for his determined stand. She
began to see dimly that this prompt and quiet decision
in Paul&rsquo;s character was one of the reasons
why Lucie loved him, and it would be the most
wholesome corrective possible to the faults in Lucie&rsquo;s
temperament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As to the question of my consent, Monsieur,&rdquo;
said Madame Bernard grimly, &ldquo;that seems to have
been settled in advance by Lucie and yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucie chased away the grimness from the old
lady&rsquo;s face by kissing her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suppose we postpone consideration of this for
a short time&mdash;a week, perhaps, you will allow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul was about to say, &ldquo;Certainly, Madame,&rdquo;
when Lucie interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say yes, Paul, it will amuse grandmama and
won&rsquo;t hurt us the least in the world.&rdquo; And then she
kissed Madame Bernard all over her face and cried:
&ldquo;Go home, Paul, and come early to-morrow. Grandmama
will be dying to see you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul left the ch&acirc;teau in much better case than he
expected and had a rapturous ride back in the twilight
with a shy young moon looking and laughing
at him.</p>

<p>As he rode into the barracks yard he passed
Toni, carrying a big bucket of water in either hand.
As he rode past he said in a whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You brought me good fortune to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all settled?&rdquo; asked Toni, in another
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite so, I think,&rdquo; replied Paul, flinging him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>self
off his horse. &ldquo;I will do a good turn by you
with the sergeant to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When he got back to his quarters Powder, who
had spent a lonely afternoon, rushed at him with
yaps of delight. Paul, twisting the dog&rsquo;s ears,
whispered: &ldquo;My lad, you and I have just got a new
commanding officer. Hurrah, you rascal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Powder immediately gave a series of terrific
yelps which he had been taught to believe were hurrahs!</p>

<p>The next morning Paul had two errands which
took him out very early. One was to send a bouquet
to Lucie, and the other was to have an interview
with Sergeant Duval. He caught the sergeant just
coming out of the riding-hall. Everything had
gone well that day and the sergeant was smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sergeant,&rdquo; cried Paul, coming up to him,
&ldquo;so I understand that my old friend Toni and Mademoiselle
Denise are to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had not heard the news, sir,&rdquo; responded Sergeant
Duval, stiffening. &ldquo;I thank you for acquainting
me with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;Toni is terribly afraid
of you, and he asked me to make the communication.
I thought perhaps something had passed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>tween
your sister and Toni&rsquo;s mother, but, at all
events, you know as much about Toni as anybody.
He is an excellent fellow, a fine soldier, and has
been in love with Mademoiselle Denise ever since
he was a small boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were more small bad boys in Bienville
than any place I ever saw, sir,&rdquo; was the sergeant&rsquo;s
discouraging reply, &ldquo;and Toni was about the worst
of the lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now, sergeant, you are too hard on Toni.
He was no worse than I was. All small boys are
bad, but all of them that I have ever seen had something
good about them. Madame Marcel, you
know, is well-to-do, and when Toni&rsquo;s time is up he
can get a place, I know, as instructor in a riding-school
at three hundred francs the month. I don&rsquo;t
think Mademoiselle Denise will do ill if you take
Toni for a son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sergeant twisted his mustache reflectively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And beside that,&rdquo; continued Paul, who had become
a marvel of duplicity, &ldquo;I understand that Madame
Marcel is smiling on you. A remarkably fine,
handsome man you are, sergeant, and I am not surprised
that Madame Marcel likes you, but she would
like you a great deal better if you would give De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>nise
to Toni. You see, it would be a nice, family
arrangement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A pleased grin overspread the sergeant&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;a man does not take a
husband for his only child without looking well
about him. It is true that Madame Marcel is well-to-do,
and I could tie up Denise&rsquo;s dowry so that
Toni couldn&rsquo;t touch it, and perhaps I will think it
over, sir, and let you know.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2></div>

<p>The sergeant&rsquo;s views on the subject of Toni&rsquo;s
marriage to Denise were very much enlightened that
afternoon by Madame Marcel&rsquo;s requesting an interview
with him in her own room. The sergeant arrayed
himself in his best uniform, paid a visit to
the barber, waxed and dyed his mustaches to the
ultimate point, and then presented himself at Madame
Marcel&rsquo;s door. Madame Marcel was the most
unsophisticated of women, but this did not mean
that she could not play a part, and play it well.
Her part was to persuade the sergeant that, after
Toni and Denise were married, she herself might become
Madame Duval, a thing she had not the slightest
idea of doing. So she received the sergeant in
the most gracious manner, smiled at him, talked
about the happiness of their children, and seemed
to think that married life was the only road to real
bliss, and that one could not marry too early or too
often. The sergeant saw that she had set her heart
on the marriage between Toni and Denise and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>he would stand no chance whatever of establishing
himself in the comfortable back room of Madame
Marcel&rsquo;s shop unless he agreed to the match. So far
he was quite correct, but in his further assumption
that by agreeing to it he was making good his title
to the armed chair which he coveted by the kitchen
stove, he was miles out of the way.</p>

<p>The result, however, was the same&mdash;that after
much running to and fro, and as many legal documents
for Denise&rsquo;s ten thousand francs as for Lucie&rsquo;s
fortune, the matter was arranged; and on the
day fortnight that they had made a family party to
the Golden Lion and had eaten and drunk in the
garden, they made an excursion to the same place
to celebrate the betrothal of Toni and Denise. It
was too late then to sit out of doors, so they had
their little feast in a private room of the Golden
Lion with a glowing fire on the hearth. Madame
Marcel insisted on being the hostess on this occasion,
and ordered a truly gorgeous supper. There
was a heart-shaped cake on the table with love
birds pecking at orange blossoms, and all the candies
were hearts and darts and loves and doves.
Everything wore a sort of St. Valentine&rsquo;s air. Denise,
in a beautiful pink silk gown, sat next Toni
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>at the table. There were several of the Duvals&rsquo;
friends and two or three of Toni&rsquo;s comrades.</p>

<p>When it was time to drink the bride&rsquo;s health,
Toni went a message out to where Madame Bernard&rsquo;s
carriage stood in the courtyard. Out stepped
Paul and Lucie, leaving Madame Bernard in the
carriage. When they appeared in the supper-room
there was a general commotion. Toni had kept this
impending honor a secret from every one, except
Denise, and Sergeant Duval was the more impressed
by the compliment of Paul Verney&rsquo;s coming
through having it sprung on him as a surprise.
Lucie shook hands with Toni, kissed Denise on the
cheek, remembered the Sergeant and Mademoiselle
Duval and Madame Marcel, bestowed bows and
smiles on all present, and, as she always did,
brought an atmosphere of kindness and gaiety with
her. Paul shook Toni&rsquo;s hand and pronounced an
eulogy upon him, looking gravely into Toni&rsquo;s eyes
at the time, and neither one of them winked. He
spoke as if, when Toni&rsquo;s time was up and he should
leave the regiment, he would be as much missed as
the colonel himself. Then he proposed the health of
the betrothed pair and it was drunk with all honors.</p>

<p>The two pairs of lovers looked at each other&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>it
recalled their childish days at Bienville. How
seldom does the course of true love run smooth, and
how smoothly had it run for them. Then Lucie
and Paul left, having almost persuaded the Duval
faction that they had done themselves great honor
by securing Toni for Denise.</p>

<p>The next morning it was Paul Verney&rsquo;s turn at
the riding-school, and as he walked along in the
crisp autumn air, feeling as if Heaven was around
him as well as above him, he came face to face with
Toni. Toni&rsquo;s eyes were wide and dark with terror,
his face was pale and he gnawed his mustache furiously.
The change since Paul had seen him the
night before was enough to shock any one. Toni
did not wait to be asked what was the matter, but,
coming close to Paul, said in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are here&mdash;Pierre and Nicolas&mdash;they lay
in wait for me when I got back to the barracks last
night&mdash;they were in the batch of recruits that came
in yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; said Paul, who was not easily
shaken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me that unless I stood by them they
would tell all about&mdash;those&mdash;those things that happened
when I was in the circus, and about Count
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Delorme&rsquo;s death, and the rest of it. You know,
sir, I am as innocent&mdash;as innocent&mdash;&rdquo; He pointed
upward to a bird that sang and swung upon a
bough close by. His speech seemed to fail him.
Nicolas and Pierre in a single night had resumed all
their old sway over him; he was once more under the
dominion of fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were not conscripted, those two rascals?&rdquo;
said Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, they told me that the authorities were hot
after them about the Delorme matter. A twenty-franc
piece was found which had a mark on it and
was traced to Count Delorme. It was the piece
which they put in my pocket and which I threw
after them. Nothing could actually be discovered
against them, but they could not well get out of the
way, so they concluded the best thing to do was to
enlist in a dragoon regiment, and as they couldn&rsquo;t
get away from this part of the country, they
thought it best not to try, and so came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni wiped his forehead, on which the big drops
stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni&rdquo;&mdash;Paul spoke sharply&mdash;&ldquo;be a man. Do
you suppose when Denise promised to marry you
that she thought she was marrying a poltroon to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>scared by a ghost&mdash;afraid of a whisk of a rabbit&rsquo;s
tail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni groaned heavily. The little while that he
had been free from fear of his secret made its return
seem the more dreadful to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a very horrible thing to feel
that you have two men at your heels ready to swear
that you have been engaged in murder and robbery
and arson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you have not committed murder and
robbery and arson, you have nothing to fear,&rdquo; replied
Paul, speaking sternly. Toni made no answer,
but shook his head. Paul then tried persuasion
on him, but nothing could lessen Toni&rsquo;s
fear of his two old companions.</p>

<p>Paul went on to the riding-school. Pierre and
Nicolas, proud of their accomplishments as riders,
were anxious to exhibit their skill. Neither of them
was as graceful a rider as Toni though, and Nicolas
was beetle-browed and red-headed, while Pierre was
a combination of a fox and a monkey. Sergeant
Duval was a judge of men, and not all their accomplishments
inclined him favorably toward them,
nor did he, after a month&rsquo;s trial, have reason to reverse
his opinion, for, from the beginning, two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>worse soldiers could not be found. They were always
under punishment; they either would not or
could not learn their duty, and it was a source of
regret to their superiors that they would receive so
many punishments they would probably be obliged
to serve another enlistment. The sergeant did his
whole duty in reporting them, and Paul Verney, in
whose troop they were, in punishing them. Paul
very much hoped that they would reach the limit
and have to be sent to Algiers as <i>disciplinaires</i>.</p>

<p>Toni went about like a man in a dream. Part of
the time he was the happiest fellow alive, and part
of the time the most miserable. In his happiest moments
with Denise, he was haunted by a dread of
what Nicolas and Pierre might do, and in his paroxysms
of fear, when he waked in the night and lay
still and trembling amid the snoring troopers
around him in the barracks, the thought of Denise
comforted him. For Denise found out that there
was something the matter with him, and gently
chid him for not telling her, and when Toni would
not, for indeed he could not, poor frightened fellow
that he was, tell her, Denise did not grow petulant,
but showed him a tender confidence. There
was much more in Denise than mere prettiness and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>blondness and neatness and coquetry. She was a
soldier&rsquo;s daughter and was not without some of
Sergeant Duval&rsquo;s resolution. So Toni found that
with all his grief and anxiety he had the quiet, unspoken
and, therefore, more helpful sympathy of
the woman he loved. Denise did not worry him with
questions&mdash;that was much.</p>

<p>The sergeant and all the men in the troop knew
of Toni&rsquo;s former associations in the circus with
Nicolas and Pierre, but as neither of the two latter
had succeeded in making himself an object of admiration
to his comrades, nothing they could say
would injure Toni. Still, they maintained their
strange power over him. Toni would have liked
never to speak to them nor to be seen with them, but
when they would come after him he had no capacity
of resistance&mdash;he would go with them, cursing them,
but unable to withstand them.</p>

<p>In the spring he was relieved of some of this.
Pierre and Nicolas had taken a special spite against
their sublieutenant, Paul Verney, and they had
shamefully abused one of his favorite chargers.
Paul promptly procured for them two months&rsquo; incarceration
in the military prison. These were two
months of Paradise to Toni. He had in him some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>thing
of a happy-go-lucky disposition, and although
he could not shake off his miserable secret
he could put it out of sight for a while. It did not
trouble him much in the day, but never failed to
visit him at night.</p>

<p>It was known, by that time, that he was to marry
Denise when the sergeant should retire on his pension,
which would be a year from the coming summer.
Like a lover, Toni had protested strongly
against this, but, as a matter-of-fact, it did not
greatly affect his happiness. He liked playing the
part of a lover and reasoned, with true Toni philosophy,
that he might well enjoy the present without
hungering too much after the future. He saw
Denise every day, danced with her three times a
week, spent every Sunday when he was off duty
with her, and ate, several times a week, most agreeable
dishes prepared by Denise&rsquo;s own hands.</p>

<p>Madame Marcel, meanwhile, had returned to
Bienville, but promised to make Toni another visit
before long. She left the sergeant far from hopeless,
and by enclosing a special package of chocolate
in the New Year box which she sent Toni and
Denise, gave him great hopes. In fact, under
Toni&rsquo;s able instruction, Madame Marcel was play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ing
the sergeant with great skill and finesse, and
that infatuated person never suspected it.</p>

<p>It was a happy time with Paul Verney, too. Like
Toni, he was an accepted lover, but his marriage
was to come off in June. He had taken a small,
pretty house in the town, for although Madame
Bernard urged and even commanded that the new
married pair should live with her, Paul Verney had
a sturdy independence about him. His two thousand
francs would pay the rent of his house and
his parents, by skimping and screwing in every possible
way, managed to scrape up two thousand
francs more, without letting Paul know how much
it encroached on their narrow income. But Lucie,
with her quick American sense, saw through it in an
instant and positively refused to let Paul take it
under any circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paul,&rdquo; she said, when the subject was broached
between them, &ldquo;I am willing to play at being poor
for your sake and for the looks of the thing, but
how absurd it is for us not to enjoy what is ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is yours, you mean,&rdquo; mumbled Paul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But yours and ours do not exist between persons
who love and understand each other as we do.
I wish, from the bottom of my heart, it were yours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>instead of mine&mdash;then, I should not have to be so
particular always to say ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Paul Verney, like other men, had to yield to
the inevitable feminine, and although they were to
live modestly enough, it was, as Lucie said, mere
playing at poverty. It seemed to Paul, in fulfilling
his childish romance as Toni had fulfilled his,
that they were drawn nearer together even than
when they were boys at Bienville. The relation of
master and servant, which had always been a fiction
of the imagination so to speak, seemed to vanish
wholly. Toni was Paul&rsquo;s humble friend and confidant.
When Paul would come home, after dining
at the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard and an evening spent basking
in Lucie&rsquo;s smiles and glances, he would feel as if
he were stepping on air, and there Toni would be,
standing at the window drawing pictures of Denise
in an old copy-book. He would glance with a
roguish smile at Paul as he helped him off with his
clothes, and say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle has been kind to-night, hasn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is always kind&mdash;the darling,&rdquo; Paul
would reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the old lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;When she is got up in her velvet gown and her
big silk mantle, and her bonnet with plumes on it,
she always reminds me of the general&rsquo;s charger at
a grand parade. And she is about as much to be
feared,&rdquo; said Paul, laughing. &ldquo;I would rather encounter
a dozen Madame Bernards than one Sergeant
Duval. I think the sergeant lives for the
purpose of catching you tripping&mdash;that is to say
in the event that your mother doesn&rsquo;t marry him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women are the oddest creatures in the world,&rdquo;
Toni said solemnly, blinking his eyes. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
my mother. She has been a widow for twenty years
and, if you believe me, the way she is fooling the
sergeant would put a sixteen-year-old girl to the
blush.&rdquo; Then Toni told about the box of chocolate.
&ldquo;And it will be boxes of chocolate straight
along until she gets me married to Denise, and then&mdash;pouf!&mdash;away
will go the sergeant. She would
not marry him to save his life. The sergeant is a
fine man, too&mdash;better than I am, but she loves me
best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These hours of confidence were not among the
least pleasant in the lives of Paul and Toni.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2></div>

<p>Early in the month of June, the month of roses,
the wedding of Paul and Lucie came off. The civil
wedding occurred one day, but the great event was
the religious ceremony on the next day. It took
place in the garrison chapel, which was beautifully
decorated for the occasion. It was a very grand
wedding, for the Bernards were great people, but
it was likewise a very happy wedding. A great
many persons wondered why a girl of Lucie Bernard&rsquo;s
beauty, fortune and position should marry
a little sublieutenant of dragoons, but when they
came to see and know the little sublieutenant, and
how much liked and respected he was by everybody,
it did not seem remarkable at all. Lucie&rsquo;s most
valued wedding present was a huge amethyst bracelet,
bought by the voluntary subscriptions of the
men in Paul&rsquo;s own troop out of their small pay.
Lucie wore it at her wedding, her only other ornament
being a modest pearl brooch which was Paul&rsquo;s
gift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a glorious June day when Lucie Bernard
became Lucie Verney. The garrison chapel was
packed, and Sergeant Duval commanded the guard
of honor. Toni, who had helped to dress Paul for
the great occasion, scampered off, with Powder
under his arm, to the church, where he met Denise
and her aunt. He escorted them to seats of honor
reserved for them, a compliment to Toni which materially
improved his standing with Mademoiselle
Duval. The church was filled with music from the
great organ, and outside the air was melodious
with the song of birds and the rustling of leaves
and the swaying of blossoms. Among the happiest
faces in the church were those of Monsieur and Madame
Verney, and also two persons that Toni had
not seen for a long time, Captain and Madame Ravenel.
Madame Ravenel was, for once, not in black,
and her pale beauty was set off by a white gown.
Her usually sad face wore a happy and tremulous
smile. She felt herself the forgiven sinner and was
not, as most sinners are, proud of her sins and contemptuous
of their forgiveness. Lucie had demanded
that Sophie and her husband be asked to the
wedding and even to stay as guests at the Ch&acirc;teau
Bernard. Madame Bernard, after having pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>tested,
vowed and declared for six months that such
should not be the case, promptly capitulated three
weeks before the wedding. This meant the complete
rehabilitation of Captain and Madame Ravenel and
their return to that world from which their own desperate
act had hurled them for a time. They had
humbled themselves and had been punished, and had
taken their punishment as proud and honorable
souls do, acknowledging its justice and making no
outcry. But now it was over, and forgiveness had
been won for them by Lucie Bernard&rsquo;s generous
and determined little hand, which had never ceased
to labor for them since she was ten years old.</p>

<p>While the church full of people was awaiting
the entrance of the bride and bridegroom, Toni
whispered to Denise that they would be married in
the same church and that he expected to be as
happy as Monsieur Paul, who was the happiest man
he had ever seen. Paul&rsquo;s countenance, when he
stood before the altar with Lucie on his arm, fully
sustained this. Many bridegrooms wear a hunted
and dejected appearance, but not so Paul Verney,
although he had been hunted and captured by the
charming creature at his side. Lucie, for once,
was subdued, but her pallor and the tears that trem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>bled
in her dark eyes did her as much honor as
Paul&rsquo;s happy countenance. She was asking herself
all the time if she were really worthy of a man like
Paul. But she recovered all her composure when
they turned and marched out of the church together
and passed under the uplifted swords of the
guard of honor, and she was quite smiling and self-possessed,
looking about her with the laughing,
playful, penetrating glance peculiarly her own, and
holding up her arm on which the big bracelet shone,
to the delight of the honest hearts of the soldiers.</p>

<p>There was a large wedding breakfast at the
Ch&acirc;teau Bernard, which was at its loveliest in June,
with its broad, green terraces, its plashing fountains
and the riot of color in its prim flower beds.
The guests sat at many little tables on the broad
terrace, where the bride and groom and the wedding
party had a very gorgeous one in the middle,
just by the fountain, which sparkled brilliantly
in the sunshine. A little way off, in a grove of elm
trees, a table was set for the soldiers who had acted
as the guard of honor at the wedding ceremony.
Their wives and sweethearts were included, and
here Toni was the great man, second only to Sergeant
Duval, who was the ranking non-commis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>sioned
officer present. Toni was the bridegroom&rsquo;s
humble friend and everybody knew the closeness of
the tie which had existed between them since boyhood.</p>

<p>Toni made a speech which was a marvel of elegance
and correctness. It had been written for him
by Paul Verney two weeks before, and he had spent
the whole fortnight getting it by heart. But at
the end Toni suddenly burst into an impromptu
speech of his own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lieutenant,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the best lieutenant,
he is the best man, he is the best master, he is the
best of everything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here Toni, without the least expectation on his
part, suddenly found the tears rolling down his
cheeks. He laughed and could not imagine what
he was crying for and then his fellows all applauded
him vociferously, and Toni sat down and was
not able to say another word. And then, when they
were through with their breakfast, they saw the
bride and groom approaching, Lucie holding up
her dainty white skirts, her filmy veil floating about
her and with nothing on her dark hair except her
wedding veil and wreath. Paul carried his helmet
with its horse-hair plume in his hand, and the sun
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>shone on his happy sunburned face as he led Lucie
to where their humble friends were making merry.
Toni had hauled out, from under the table, a mysterious
box filled with ice and with long-necked
bottles, and champagne was soon bubbling in every
glass. The sergeant made a speech quite out of
his own head, and much better than Toni&rsquo;s, in which
he assured Paul Verney of what he knew before&mdash;that
his troop would die for him to a man. Paul returned
thanks and declared that he was conscious
of commanding the finest troop in the French army,
and then Lucie said a few pretty words of thanks
and held up her arm with the great bracelet on it
and showed that she had worn no other ornament
except that and the bridegroom&rsquo;s gift. Then there
were more cheers, more champagne, more of everything.
It was a very happy wedding because it
made many persons happy.</p>

<p>The very happiest person at the wedding, next
to Paul and Lucie, was Madame Verney. That excellent
woman was fully persuaded that by her efforts
alone and single-handed, she had brought
about this match between Paul and Lucie, which
otherwise never would have taken place. The relatives
and friends of the Bernards were very grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>people, indeed, but Paul had no reason to be
ashamed of his family contingent.</p>

<p>When the guests were all gone and only the family
remained, Toni requested Paul to let the party
from Bienville, consisting of himself and the Duvals,
speak to the Bienville persons present&mdash;the
Verneys and the Ravenels,&mdash;and this Paul very
gladly did. The Ravenels and the Verneys were
very kind, as was their nature, to their humbler
friends from their native town. Paul did Toni a
very good service by proclaiming before all the
Bienville people, in Sergeant Duval&rsquo;s presence, that
Toni was the best fellow alive and the sergeant was
doing well to betroth his daughter to such an excellent
fellow. This was accepted by the Bienville people
because on that glorious day everything went
well. They could not but observe, however, that
Toni was clean instead of being dirty, and Paul assured
them that he had become as industrious as he
had before been idle.</p>

<p>When the carriage drove off, in the summer dusk,
with the bride and groom starting on their wedding
journey, Toni was the last person with whom
they shook hands, as he arranged them comfortably,
and then Toni whispered to Denise:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We will be just as happy as they some day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Toni waked up with a feeling
of happiness which had been gradually growing
on him ever since he had become a private soldier
under Paul Verney. This made him long to
whistle and sing like a blackbird had not the regulations
forbidden soldiers to sing like blackbirds
while at their duties. But the first sight that greeted
him, as he marched on the parade ground, gave
him an unpleasant shock. There were Nicolas and
Pierre in the ranks. Their term of imprisonment
had expired, and these two unworthy citizens were
restored to their duties.</p>

<p>Toni avoided them all day long as much as he
could, and in the evening, being off duty, he went
into the town to see Denise. After spending half
an hour with her, sitting on a bench in the public
square while Mademoiselle Duval read her inevitable
religious newspaper, a drizzle of rain coming on,
he escorted his fianc&eacute;e and his future aunt-in-law to
their lodging, then walked down into the town to
spend the hour that yet remained to him before he
was obliged to turn in. The night had grown dark
and stormy and the rain had become a determined
downpour. The street lamps shone fitfully out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>the gloom, but the windows of the cheap caf&eacute;s,
where the soldiers congregated, were resplendent
with lights.</p>

<p>Toni was standing before one of these and debating
whether he should go in when he felt an
arm on each side of him. He looked around and
Nicolas&rsquo; red head was close to his ear, while Pierre&rsquo;s
monkey face was on the other side of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Nicolas, &ldquo;I know where we can get
a good bottle of wine and have a game of cards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni could easily have wrenched himself free
from them, but his old cowardice returned to him
with a rush. He went sullenly with them under
a moral compulsion which he could not have explained
to save his life. He hated and feared their
company; nevertheless, he went with them. They
turned into a dark and narrow side street and then,
diving into a blind alley so dark and noisome that
Toni&rsquo;s heart sank within him at the thought of the
crimes that could be committed there, they climbed
a rickety outside stair by the side of a tumble-down
old house. Toni found himself presently in a
garret room, dimly lighted by a malodorous oil
lamp. It was evidently a place of entertainment
for a low class of persons. There were sounds of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>voices below them and next them, but this room
was unoccupied. There was a table in the middle
of the floor and wine and glasses on it. Toni sat
down, much against his will, and Pierre, pouring
out some of the wine, which was vile, began to expatiate
on the delights of liberty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a million times better,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;than
being locked up in prison with the devil of a sentry
keeping his eye on one perpetually and three days
on bread and water for sneezing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni longed to say that that was what both of
them richly deserved, but dared not. Then Nicolas
began:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should not have been imprisoned at all but
for that scoundrel, Lieutenant Verney. He has a
spite against us and takes it out as only an officer
can on a private soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; cried Toni. This aspersion on their
honor was not in the least resented by either Pierre
or Nicolas, who knew, as only they and God did,
what liars they were.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Toni,&rdquo; Nicolas continued, &ldquo;I understand
that you are to marry the sergeant&rsquo;s daughter.
My faith, you look prosperous. Count Delorme&rsquo;s
money must have done you a lot of good.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I never had any of Count Delorme&rsquo;s money!&rdquo;
burst out Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is lying now?&rdquo; murmured Nicolas softly.
&ldquo;What about the twenty-franc piece?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was certainly a very neat job of yours,
Toni,&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;I have never seen a man done
for quicker than you did for Count Delorme. One
blow like this&mdash;&rdquo; He drew off and went through a
pantomime of giving Nicolas a blow on the side of
the head. Nicolas, likewise pretending, tumbled
over in his chair as Count Delorme had fallen over
in the dark at the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard. It made Toni
sick to see them. They laughed, after they had
gone through with this mimic tragedy, and began
to drink their wine. Then they again abused Paul
Verney, and Toni said nothing. He scorned to defend
his friend from two such scoundrels as those
before him and he longed to get away, but that
strange and inscrutable fear of them nailed him to
his chair. Presently Nicolas said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni, we might as well tell you the truth. Lieutenant
Verney is to die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To die! Paul, so full of life, so happy, only
yesterday married! He saw Paul&rsquo;s smiling face as
he waved his hand back to Toni when he drove off in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>the open carriage with Lucie, through the golden
dusk of the June evening. But he did not quite take
in what Nicolas meant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Pierre, &ldquo;have you never heard, my
man, of officers who abused and ill-treated their
men, who were found dead like Count Delorme?&mdash;I
won&rsquo;t say murdered&mdash;that&rsquo;s an ugly word to say.
But it isn&rsquo;t altogether safe for an officer to persecute
a man, particularly a couple of men&mdash;it&rsquo;s just
as well to make an example of an officer like that
once in a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cold horror came upon Toni. After a moment
he spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you mean to waylay Lieutenant Verney as
you did Count Delorme?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No indeed, my dear fellow,&rdquo; briskly responded
Nicolas. &ldquo;It will be quite a different affair from
that little one of yours. We mean to kill him, however,
but we will try our chances among the three
of us. We don&rsquo;t care to take the whole risk ourselves,
and I think, considering how quiet we have
kept about that little affair of yours in the park of
the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard that you ought to help us
out. So we will play a game of cards and the loser
is to finish up Lieutenant Verney or be finished up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>himself. That is quite fair. Don&rsquo;t you agree to
that, Pierre?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pierre nodded and grinned. Toni sat looking at
them stupidly by the light of the oil lamp. He took
in instantly what they meant&mdash;they intended that
he should kill Paul Verney or else be killed himself.
Nicolas took out of his pocket a greasy pack of
cards and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall it be&mdash;&eacute;cart&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; responded Pierre.</p>

<p>Toni would have given his soul, almost, to have
rushed out of the room, but he was Toni still as
boy and man. He had been cowed and enslaved by
certain strange fears which many persons exercised
over him, and these scoundrels in particular. He
thought of himself as murdered by these wretches,
who, he knew, would do it with as little compunction
as they would wring the neck of a chicken.
He thought of Denise, of Paul Verney, and he was
overwhelmed with sorrow for them and pity for
himself, for he understood that he must die.</p>

<p>The cards were dealt and Toni took his up. He
was in a horrible dream, but he retained enough of
his faculties to know how the game was going.
Nicolas and Pierre were quite cheerful and they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>squabbled merrily over the game and took all the
tricks. When they had finished, Nicolas slapped
Toni on the back and said jovially:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my man, you have got the job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni made no reply. He was too frightened to
speak, and then Nicolas, suddenly growing perfectly
serious, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know we begin our practice marches in
about a fortnight. Now, on our first practice
march you are to be ill and drop out of the ranks&mdash;see?&mdash;when
the lieutenant is riding by the side of
the troop where he can see you, and you must select
a place where there is a thicket in which a man&rsquo;s
body can be hid from the observation of the people
passing by. Now, when the lieutenant comes back
to see what is the matter with you, it will be quite
easy&mdash;he will be completely off his guard&mdash;and
then&mdash;you had better do it with a knife&mdash;a knife
makes no noise, you know, and if you don&rsquo;t know
how to use a knife on Lieutenant Verney&mdash;well,
we&rsquo;ll use it on you&mdash;that&rsquo;s all&mdash;and on Lieutenant
Verney later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni&rsquo;s arms dropped by his side and he uttered
a low groan. What folly ever had thrown him with
these men&mdash;what madness was his not to have come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>out and told the truth about Count Delorme! And
now his life must pay the penalty for it, and just
as it was growing so sweet to him. He staggered
to his feet and groped his way to the door, Pierre
and Nicolas making no effort to stop him. They
saw that they had fully impressed him with what
they meant to do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2></div>

<p>Toni got back to the barracks, he knew not how,
stumbling along through the rain and darkness,
and throwing himself on his rough bed lay awake
and agonized the whole night through until the
bugle call next morning. He could not eat that
whole day nor sleep the next night and pined like
a woman. During that day he saw Nicolas and
Pierre a dozen times at least, and they always
flashed him a mocking glance which he understood
perfectly well and which gave him a feeling as if a
red-hot iron hand were clutching his heart, for
Toni was of an imaginative nature.</p>

<p>He did not see Denise that day, and spent another
sleepless and horror-stricken night. The
next morning it occurred to him, as a means of
escaping Denise&rsquo;s tender and searching eyes, as
well as the hateful company of Pierre and Nicolas,
that he might possibly sham illness and be sent to
the hospital. He did not need to sham, however&mdash;he
was in a high fever and the surgeon swore at him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>for not reporting before, so he found a temporary
haven of refuge in the hospital. There he spent
several days. The doctor, who was a clever young
fellow, was a good deal puzzled by the case. He
could not make out whether Toni was malingering
or not. He evidently wished to be considered ill&mdash;at
the same time there were indications about him
of his being really ill. If he had not had the reputation
of being an admirable soldier, the doctor
would have suspected Toni had done something
wrong and was in hiding, as it were, in the hospital.</p>

<p>The sergeant called to see him and was rather
rough with him considering that nothing was the
matter with Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would lie here and take all these
nasty messes if there were nothing the matter with
me?&rdquo; cried poor Toni.</p>

<p>There was indeed something very serious the
matter with him, but it was a kind of suffering
which not all the doctor&rsquo;s instruments and medicines
could reach. Denise, with her aunt, called
twice to see him, but both times Toni feigned to be
asleep as soon as he distinguished their voices, and
it was against the rules to disturb him.</p>

<p>A week passed, on the second morning of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>he found a long, sharp knife under his pillow, and
at the end of that time the doctor turned Toni out
of the hospital, much against the latter&rsquo;s will. He
had then to resume his duties, of course, and affect
cheerfulness as well as he could. He succeeded
rather better in the last respect than might have
been expected, and Denise only saw in him the
weakness and lassitude which she thought were due
to his recent illness.</p>

<p>On the day fortnight after Paul Verney&rsquo;s wedding,
he returned with his bride&mdash;the honeymoon
of a sublieutenant is inevitably brief. The very
next day the practice march was to begin and Toni
did not see Paul Verney until the next morning
when the troop was forming in the barracks square.</p>

<p>The regiment marched out with colors flying to
do a practice march of two days&rsquo; duration. Paul
was riding at the head of his troop. He was a fine
horseman and had a good military air and everything
about him was spick and span as becomes an
officer.</p>

<p>Toni, who was at the end of the file, got a good
look at Paul as he cantered along by the side of the
troopers and a look of affectionate intelligence
flashed between the two young men. Toni saw that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>Paul was truly happy&mdash;he was in fact always
happy when performing his military duties, because
he was born a soldier, apt at obedience and
ready at command. In the same file with Toni rode
Nicolas and Pierre.</p>

<p>They passed out of the town on the dusty
highroad, their helmets gleaming in the sun and
the steady tramp of their horses&rsquo; hoofs sounding
like thunder on the highroad and raising a great
white dust like a pillar of cloud by day. Crowds
of people ran out to see them, and cheered them as
they passed. The day was bright and warm, but
not hot enough to distress either the men or the
horses. They kept on steadily until noon, when
there was an hour of rest and refreshment. Again
they took up the line of march. A cool breeze was
blowing and it was as pleasant a June day as one
could wish for marching. Towards three o&rsquo;clock,
as they were passing the outskirts of a wood, Toni
put his hand to his head and reeled in his saddle.
His horse kept on steadily in the ranks. It was
very well simulated and Paul rode up and caught
Toni by the arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had better drop out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and rest a
while by the roadside and rejoin when you feel bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>ter.&rdquo;
Toni touched his cap and said, &ldquo;Thank you,
sir,&rdquo; and slipping out of his saddle, led his horse
to a grassy place under a tree, where he sat down
and mopped his face. He looked quite pale and
weak, but the surgeon, when he rode up, gave him
a sharp look, made him drink some wine and water
out of his canteen, and said: &ldquo;You will be all right
in ten minutes,&rdquo; and rode on.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed and twenty and thirty. The
regiment was out of sight. Toni&rsquo;s troop was a
part of the rear guard. The dull echo of thousands
of hoofs still resounded afar off, but all else was
quiet in that shaded woody spot, with farm-houses
basking in the sun, the highroad gleaming whitely,
and the railway beyond making two streaks of steel-blue
light in the distance. Toni, with his helmet
off, and his horse browsing quietly near him, sat on
the ground under the shade with the glaring midday
light around him and waited for Paul Verney,
who he knew would return. No lieutenant in the
regiment looked so closely after his men as he.
Presently Toni heard the galloping of a horse and
the rattling of a saber in its scabbard, and there
was Paul riding up. He swung himself off his
horse and came up to Toni and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I came back to see what was the matter with
you. I thought you would have rejoined by this
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni made no reply, but raised his black eyes to
Paul&rsquo;s blue ones and they were so full of misery that
Paul involuntarily put his hand on Toni&rsquo;s shoulder
and asked, &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni tried to speak, but the words would not
come. Paul, putting his hand in his breast, drew
out a small flask of brandy and poured the best
part of it down Toni&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni&rsquo;s vocabulary was not extensive and he
hunted around in his mind for language to express
the horror of what he was suffering, but he could
only find the simplest words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nicolas and Pierre&mdash;,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;those scoundrels&mdash;have
ordered me to kill you. They say if
I don&rsquo;t they will kill me and kill you afterward
themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute or two after this.</p>

<p>Paul knew very well that Toni was neither drunk
nor crazy, and he grasped at once all that Toni
meant. His face grew pale and his blond mustache
twitched a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;So they want to put me out of the way&mdash;what
for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they think you are responsible for
their being in trouble so much. They are desperate
men, Paul.&rdquo; Toni used Paul&rsquo;s name unconsciously,
but he was thinking then of Paul as he
had known him years ago, an apple-cheeked boy
who understood him and even understood Jacques.</p>

<p>Paul took his helmet off and let the cool breeze
blow on his close-cropped sandy hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me all about it&mdash;how
it happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is about Count Delorme,&rdquo; said Toni, gasping
between his sentences. &ldquo;You know, Paul, I
always was a coward about most things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when I was in the circus those two rascals
used to take me with them sometimes on their robbing
expeditions and make me keep watch and help
to carry off the stolen things. I was frightened to
death at what they made me do&mdash;too frightened to
refuse to go with them. I never knew of their killing
anybody, except Count Delorme, but that night
they waylaid him in the dark, I swear to you&mdash;oh!
God, I swear to you a million times&mdash;I never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>touched Count Delorme. I thought they were going
to rob him only&mdash;I did not dream they were
going to kill him. But he resisted when they tried
to get his money, and Nicolas struck him a blow
and he fell over. And they put a twenty-franc
piece in my pocket and swore that I had killed him
and robbed him. Then I determined to get away
from them and so, when I was conscripted, I could
have got off because I was the only son of a widow,
but I thought if I were in the army I might escape
them and I meant then to hunt for you and to tell
you all about it. And I thought I had escaped
them&mdash;oh! how happy I was&mdash;but they turned up
as you know and I have not had a moment&rsquo;s peace
since. Two weeks ago they forced me to go with
them&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Forced you to go with them!&rsquo;&rdquo; said Paul indignantly.
&ldquo;Toni, you are the greatest coward.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied Toni. &ldquo;I always was. And
they told me that they meant to kill you and we
played a game of cards to determine whether they
should do it or I&mdash;<i>I</i>&mdash;think of it! Of course I
lost, and they promised me if I didn&rsquo;t kill you that
I should be killed. And they told me to drop out
of the ranks and that you would come after me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>and they put this knife where I could find it.&rdquo; Toni
drew it from his bosom. It was an ordinary table
knife, but of well-tempered steel and as sharp as
a razor. &ldquo;And I was to kill you and leave your
body here where it could not be found for several
hours&mdash;and make the best of my way off. Of
course, I should have been caught and guillotined,
but what did they care about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni turned and threw the knife as far as he
could into the bosky thicket behind him. Paul Verney,
who was as quiet as a lamb and as brave as a
lion, looked at Toni sorrowfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can get rid of those two rapscallions
in time,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;get them sent to Algiers. But
they will have to come back sometime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I know,&rdquo; said Toni. &ldquo;We are
under sentence of death, Paul, and it is all my
fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ghost of a smile came into Paul Verney&rsquo;s
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;not exactly your fault,
Toni. You were born that way, so you can&rsquo;t help
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we are both so happy,&rdquo; cried Toni, and
at this he burst into a passion of tears, sobbing as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>he had not sobbed since he was a small boy and
his mother had the rheumatism and he thought she
was going to die. Paul turned his back and walked
up and down in front of Toni for a minute or two,
and when he spoke his voice was husky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are both very happy, or
would be except for those wretches. But, Toni, you
must keep every hint of this from Denise and I
shall certainly keep it from my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may be able to,&rdquo; replied poor Toni, &ldquo;because
you are brave and self-possessed, but you
know how I am. I am likely to let it out any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you do,&rdquo; said Paul sternly, &ldquo;you may look
to hear from me. Toni, have you no shame at being
such a coward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; replied Toni. &ldquo;As you say, I
was born that way. I am not afraid of horses nor
of guns nor of anything that other people are
afraid of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul inspected Toni in wrath and sorrow. He
was the identical Toni that had enjoyed a ride on
the runaway horse, and was cowed and terrified by
the laughs and jeers of a couple of the tailor
Clery&rsquo;s boys, either of whom he was perfectly well
able to thrash if he had wished. Paul Verney was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>not, physically, half the man that Toni was, but
not all the five Clery boys, with their father at their
head, could have frightened him when he was a
very small boy himself. Paul would have taken a
thrashing from them one day and be ready to repeat
it the next, but the mere thought of a thrashing
frightened Toni out of his wits.</p>

<p>How much more, then, did the thought of being
murdered scare him! Yet if Toni had been driven
into the forlorn hope&mdash;&ldquo;the last children&rdquo; as the
French picturesquely put it&mdash;he would have behaved
as well as any man in it.</p>

<p>Paul Verney looked around him at the smiling,
peaceful landscape basking in the afternoon light,
and thought of Lucie at the ch&acirc;teau. She was
probably practising her music at that hour, and
then she would go for her afternoon ride with only
a groom to accompany her. He would be absent
from her for two whole days, and Lucie had spent
a week in devising schemes for getting rid of the
time. Paul was as much in love with her as she
was with him, but it never occurred to him that
there was any difficulty in getting rid of the time
during his absence from her&mdash;he had his work to do
and he meant to do it well, nor did he let the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>thought of Lucie interfere in the least with his
duty. He had cheerfully given that promise demanded
of all lovers, that he would tell Lucie everything.
As he had nothing to tell her of the least
harm, or of the least consequence, he had laughingly
made the promise. But now there was something
he must conceal from her; something, the
mere thought of which would blight that merry,
beautiful, rose-in-bloom life that Lucie was leading;
something which, if it ever came to pass, would
blight it altogether.</p>

<p>Paul pulled himself together and turned his
mind, as he had the power to do, resolutely away
from the grisly probability presented to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Toni,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think about this thing.
I believe I can get those two scoundrels out of the
way, and I will; so take another pull out of this
brandy flask and get on your horse and follow me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni did as he was told and was soon galloping
at Paul Verney&rsquo;s heels. The thought of Denise
was before him. He knew that sometime he should
tell her&mdash;he could not keep it from her&mdash;and what
would Denise say, and what would she do?&mdash;be
scared as he was? Presently they found themselves
in the cloud of dust which enveloped the regiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>and Toni made his way to his place at the end of
the file, Paul Verney cantering past. As Toni
reined up he looked around the file and saw the
red mustache and ferret-like eyes of Nicolas peering
out along the line of mustached and helmeted
heads. Nicolas gave him an indescribable look&mdash;a
look with murder in it. Toni had had his chance,
and Paul Verney had come back unharmed. That
night in the bivouac Nicolas and Pierre came up
to Toni and Nicolas whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have two more chances&mdash;we will give you
three opportunities all together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni said not a word in reply. He only wondered
dumbly, how much of life that meant for
him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2></div>

<p>On the afternoon of the day when they returned
to Beaupr&eacute; Paul Verney ordered Toni to report to
him at the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard for a message. Paul
and Lucie were having tea together at a little table
on the terrace when Toni arrived. Anything more
brilliant and sparkling than Lucie&rsquo;s face could not
be imagined. She smiled charmingly on Toni, inquired
after Denise and sent word to her to come
to the ch&acirc;teau. Paul looked as cheerful and composed
as ever, and said to Lucie in quite a matter-of-fact,
husbandlike manner:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have some business to attend to, so I must ask
you to excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lucie had found out this early in her married
life, that when Paul had business to attend to she
must vanish, which she did promptly. Then Paul,
lighting his cigar gaily, said to Toni, standing at
attention, the picture of dejection:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Toni, I think I have settled those two
fellows. I had a talk with the colonel about them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>to-day and he says that while we were away on the
practice march some of their doings came to light,
and that we would be able to send them to Algiers
as <i>disciplinaires</i>. There is a batch going off next
week, and we shall try to send our friends along
with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long will they be away?&rdquo; asked Toni.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; replied Paul. &ldquo;We can only
send them for a year as it is&mdash;if they keep on as
they have been behaving here they may have to
spend the rest of their lives in Algiers. But to get
them out of the way for the present is good fortune
enough. I have told the colonel the whole story
about Count Delorme, and what a perfectly abject
coward you are, Toni, in many ways, and he agrees
with me that we had better not open the whole subject,
but just get these two rascals off quietly. So
if you can manage to keep from bawling like a
baby for the next week and will be only half a man,
the thing can be settled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; said Toni, without making any
promise of not bawling like a baby.</p>

<p>The good news, however, did enable him to keep
from letting the whole thing out to Denise. She
found Toni rather depressed and unhappy during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>that week, but on the morning when the batch of
hard cases was put on the train to be started for
Marseilles, and Nicolas and Pierre were among
them, Toni&rsquo;s heart bounded with joy. He could
not deny himself the pleasure of seeing his two old
comrades off. They were the most sullen and angry
of all the sullen and angry <i>disciplinaires</i> sent
to atone for their misdeeds under the fierce sun of
Africa. As the train moved slowly off, Nicolas
thrust his red head out of the window and, shaking
his fist at Toni, cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget&mdash;we shan&rsquo;t forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni, however, tried his best to forget, and succeeded
beyond his expectations. He had thought
himself lucky when Nicolas and Pierre were out of
sight, but now, when he remembered that they were
in Africa, and called to mind all the chances of
fever and cholera and other things that, if they
befell his two comrades in arms, would be of distinct
benefit to him, he felt positively cheerful, and,
as Paul Verney said, if Pierre and Nicolas kept up
their career as they had done since they had joined
the regiment, they would probably leave their
bones in Africa.</p>

<p>So Toni, thrusting off his load of care, more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>than he had ever done since that secret of the woods
at midnight and the dead man lying stark with his
face upturned to the murky sky had been laid upon
him, grew merry at heart. There was a good deal to
make him happy then. Denise was thoroughly devoted
to him, and the sergeant, who was being
very skilfully played by Madame Marcel, became
perfectly reconciled to the match between Toni and
Denise. After all, even if Sergeant Duval did not
succeed in marrying Madame Marcel, he reflected
that Toni would not be ill provided for, as Madame
Marcel was extremely well off for a lady of her
condition. As a means of advancing Toni&rsquo;s interests,
Madame Marcel was always writing to the
sergeant asking him how she should invest such
considerable sums as six hundred francs and once
even nine hundred francs. This last sum was so
very imposing that the sergeant, in giving her his
advice, felt compelled to renew his offer of his hand
and heart. To this Madame Marcel returned a
most diplomatic reply. She said if she could see
Toni married to Denise she would feel more like
considering the offer. At present it was her only
desire to see that happy event come off. Then, possibly,
after providing liberally for Toni, she might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>take the sergeant&rsquo;s offer under reflection. The
sergeant, after receiving this letter, thought himself
as good as married to Madame Marcel.</p>

<p>The autumn and the winter passed as pleasantly
as the summer. Paul and Lucie, after spending
the summer at the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard, had come
into the town and taken the small house in which
they played at being poor. It was as pretty a little
bower as any newly-married couple ever had.
They kept only three servants and Toni still waited
on Paul Verney, and there was plenty for him to
do. He had no natural love for work and still
reckoned it the height of bliss to lie on his stomach
in the long grass and watch the gnats dancing
in the sun and the foolishly industrious bees, always
at work for others, get gloriously drunk on
the clover blossoms. But for a private in the
dragoons there was not much time for this sort of
thing, and if Toni had to work he would rather
work for the Verneys than for anybody else. There
was a little garden behind the house in which Toni
dug and planted and watered diligently under
Lucie&rsquo;s critical eye, and this was the least unpleasant
work that he had ever done.</p>

<p>Lucie fathomed his character as well as Paul did.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>She knew of all his strange ins and outs, his courage
and cowardice, his foolish loving heart. Denise,
by that time, had got the upper hand of Toni
as completely as Paul Verney had got the upper
hand of Lucie. Like all tender-hearted women,
Lucie was a natural and incurable match-maker.
Nothing pleased her better than to forward the
affair between Toni and Denise. She stopped
Sergeant Duval in the street to praise Toni&rsquo;s virtues,
expatiating upon his industry. The sergeant
listened respectfully enough until Toni&rsquo;s industry
was mentioned, when a grim look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he is the most industrious
fellow alive as long as I am after him and
he has the prospect of being put in the barrack
prison on bread and water. Oh, there is nobody
who works harder than Toni.&rdquo; Lucie passed on
laughing.</p>

<p>But there was a reason why Toni was so willing
always to dig in the garden. There was a little
sewing-room on the ground floor which had a window
that opened on the garden, and at that window
Denise, early in the winter, was established
with her sewing. She was a beautiful seamstress,
and having ten thousand francs to her fortune by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>no means lessened her inclination to work for the
good wages which Madame Verney paid her. And
there was a great deal of sewing to be done just
then in the little house, so while Toni dug and
planted in the garden and worked among the
flowers in the little greenhouse, he could glance up
and see Denise&rsquo;s pretty blond head bending over
her fine sewing. Toni became so devoted to waiting
on Lucie that he grew positively inattentive
to Paul, who was compelled to swear at Toni once
in a while and threaten to cuff him to bring him
to his senses.</p>

<p>At New Year&rsquo;s Paul&rsquo;s father and mother and
Captain and Madame Ravenel came to Beaupr&eacute;
for a visit. The little house could not accommodate
more than two persons besides the master and
mistress, so Monsieur and Madame Verney were entertained
in great style at the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard
by Madame Bernard. Toni had never been able
to see Madame Ravenel without being reminded,
as Paul had told him in their boyhood, of a soft
and solemn strain of music in a dim cathedral, or
of the river taking its way at twilight softly
through the grassy meadow where the violets grew.
She was still sad&mdash;she never could be anything but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>that&mdash;but her beautiful eyes had lost their troubled
look and she seemed at peace. Captain Ravenel
was the same quiet, silent, soldierly man as always,
who was never far from Madame Ravenel&rsquo;s
side. No woman was ever better loved and protected
than poor Sophie. On this visit, for the
first time, Toni plucked up spirit enough to speak
to Madame Ravenel. She talked with him, in her
gentle voice, about Bienville and his life there, and
of Denise, and how she had been amused at watching
them when they were little children together.
Toni told Madame Ravenel how he dodged furtively
around the corner of the acacia tree and
climbed upon the garden wall to see her pass to
and from church. Madame Ravenel went to
church as much as ever, but now she went a little
way within the church, though never close up to
the altar, and Captain Ravenel maintained his old
practice of escorting her to church and walking
up and down in the street smoking his cigar until
she came out, when he escorted her home again,
and never let her be one waking moment without
his protection.</p>

<p>Since Lucie had come into her American fortune
the Ravenels no longer found it necessary to prac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>tise
that stern economy which had characterized
the first years of their married life. Lucie made
Sophie accept an allowance, small indeed compared
with the fortune which Delorme had squandered,
but it was enough to lift the Ravenels above poverty.
The week that the Ravenels and the Verneys
were at Beaupr&eacute; was a time of quiet happiness to
everybody in the modest house in which Lucie
played at being poor. Madame Bernard had, of
course, declared at first that she could only see
Sophie and Ravenel surreptitiously, as it were, but
ended, as she invariably did, by driving up in her
great coach and absolutely taking Sophie to drive
in the face of all Beaupr&eacute;. This was Lucie&rsquo;s doing,
unaided by either of the persons concerned, by
Paul, or by Captain Ravenel, but Lucie was accustomed
to triumphs of this sort and knew perfectly
well how to achieve them.</p>

<p>One morning, a year after Paul&rsquo;s marriage, when
Toni went to him at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning,
he found Paul already up and dressed and walking
in the garden, and he shouted, as Toni came in:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a boy, Toni.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that very day Toni was taken up stairs
into a darkened room where, in a lace and silk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>covered bassinet lay the little Paul, who seemed
to Toni at once grotesque and sacred, as indeed it
seemed to Paul himself. The baby waxed and
thrived, and, after a while, when Lucie and Paul
again had their breakfast in the garden, as they
had done in their early married life, the baby was
brought out and lay in his nurse&rsquo;s arms blinking
solemnly at the great wide world before him. Paul
Verney was a devoted father, and as he had talked
intimately with Toni all his life, so he talked with
him about this child so longed for and so loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, Toni,&rdquo; said Paul, one morning
after breakfast in the garden, when Lucie and the
baby had gone within for their noonday rest, and
Paul was looking over some papers which Toni had
brought him, &ldquo;it seems to me, Toni, as if I am too
happy. It makes me afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A look of fear came into Toni&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel the same way,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;everything
seems to be too easy&mdash;too bright. Now, if the
sergeant had kept on opposing me or if Mademoiselle
Duval were against me&mdash;but I do assure
you, Paul, they are both as sweet as milk. I don&rsquo;t
know how long it will last, but if it lasts until I
marry Denise that will be long enough. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>mother has just sold a little piece of ground she
had, on the outskirts of Bienville, and has got a
thumping price for it. I think the sergeant is
more in love with her than ever, since she sold the
ground for such a price.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Toni,&rdquo; answered Paul gaily, &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t
deserve our happiness&mdash;that much is certain. I
am no more fit for Lucie than you are fit for Denise&mdash;she&rsquo;s
a thousand times too good for you and always
will be&mdash;but we can enjoy our happiness just
the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another year passed, and Toni had come to believe
that this earth was Heaven and would have
been most unwilling to leave it for the brightest
prospects above. Denise was then very busy sewing
at her wedding trousseau, and Toni would be
Paul&rsquo;s servant only a little while longer. A corporal
was Toni to become&mdash;an honor that Toni
had no more dreamed of than of succeeding President
Loubet. This honor was equally astonishing
to Sergeant Duval. But all the same Toni was to
be promoted and was not to ride in the ranks any
longer. This distinction he had not coveted, as it
implied a great deal more work even than he had
to do as a private soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>But one must accept honors even when thrust
upon one. It made the prospect of the riding-school
seem less attractive to Toni. He not only
began to feel that the separation from Paul would
be harder than ever, but from Lucie also, and the
little baby Paul. In some unaccountable way this
little morsel of humanity had stolen his way into
Toni&rsquo;s heart, so much so, that when the baby preferred
to play with Jacques in preference to all the
expensive toys which were lavished on him, Toni
actually tied Jacques around the baby&rsquo;s neck and
made a solemn gift of it to him. It seemed almost
incredible to Toni that he could give Jacques away,
but it was to him very like the bestowal of a splendid
heirloom on a child who is to carry on the traditions
of a great family.</p>

<p>As for the sergeant, ever since Madame Marcel
had sold her piece of ground, he had treated Toni
as a son. When Toni was made a corporal, he
could command his own time much more than when
he had been a private soldier, but Denise, like most
brides, was so taken up with the important matter
of the trousseau that she had very little time to bestow
on Toni. Toni, never having questioned her
authority in his life, quietly submitted to this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 206px;">
<a id="illo14"><img src="images/i_296.jpg" width="206" alt="&ldquo;A corporal was Toni to become.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;A corporal was Toni to become.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p class="smgap">At last the great day drew near&mdash;it was only a
week off&mdash;the day of Toni&rsquo;s marriage. Toni expected
to be frightened to death, but Paul warned
him that if he showed the white feather he should
have the long-promised cuffing as soon as he returned
from his wedding tour. The sergeant also
suspected Toni&rsquo;s courage and kept a stern eye on
him in the last day or so before the wedding, but
Toni maintained his courage and declared the only
thing he dreaded was the march up the aisle of the
church and back again, in which apprehension he
did not stand alone among bridegrooms. Although
it was only the wedding of a corporal and the sergeant&rsquo;s
daughter, it was to be quite a grand affair,
chiefly through the exertions of Lucie, who dearly
loved to make a gala out of everything and particularly
out of Toni&rsquo;s and Denise&rsquo;s marriage. She had
bestowed presents on them with a lavish hand and
Paul, out of his small pay and allowance, had given
Toni a handsome gold watch.</p>

<p>The great question of the honeymoon and where
it was to be spent came up. Being a corporal, Toni
could get a short leave&mdash;how much he did not
know.</p>

<p>The next day Toni laid his case before Paul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>when he and Lucie were at breakfast in the garden.
The boy could now toddle about, his dark, bright
eyes like his mother&rsquo;s. He was fonder than ever
of Toni and liked to be carried on his strong arm.
Toni was holding the baby thus and he was clutching
Jacques devotedly in his little hand. Lucie suggested
a whole week, but Paul shook his head at
the mention of a week&rsquo;s leave for a corporal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be very unusual,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Lucie said nothing at all, but when Paul had
gone off, went up, and, taking the baby out of
Toni&rsquo;s arms and laying her soft cheek against little
Paul&rsquo;s rose-leaf face, said to Toni:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she did, in a manner precisely like Lucie.
She dressed herself in her prettiest gown and hat,
took her white lace parasol and, getting into a carriage,
went in search of the colonel of the regiment.
When she found him she poured out the story of
Toni and Denise and all about Bienville, including
her childish love affair with Paul. And then she
went on and recounted with such inimitable drollery
her efforts to wring an offer out of Paul, his horror
at her American ways of doing things, and the perplexity
which a Frenchman always experiences in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>his love-affairs with an American, that the colonel
burst out laughing and agreed to do anything
Lucie should ask, and what she asked was one whole
week of leave for Toni&rsquo;s honeymoon. The colonel
also promised to protect Lucie from Paul&rsquo;s wrath
when he should hear how Toni&rsquo;s leave had been obtained.
This was needed, for Paul scowled and
growled that women should not meddle with such
things, to which Lucie promptly agreed, except
when it should be some affair in which, like this, a
woman was deeply interested.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duval hankered very much to go
on the honeymoon with Toni and Denise, but having
heard that Paris was a very sinful place she
doubted the wisdom of trusting herself there even
for a visit. Toni contrived to make her understand
that Paris was a great deal more sinful even than
she suspected it to be, that there were few churches
and the means of salvation were limited, and finally
convinced Mademoiselle Duval that she would risk
her soul&rsquo;s salvation by venturing in that wicked
town.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2></div>

<p>Toni and Denise had selected for their wedding
day the anniversary of the marriage of Paul and
Lucie two years before. The wedding was as fine
as Lucie could make it, and she had great capabilities
in that line. The garrison chapel was decked
with flowers, the organ played, and it was much
more like the wedding of a lieutenant than a corporal&mdash;Lucie
paying for it all. Madame Marcel
came from Bienville to the wedding and was resplendent
in a purple silk gown, a lace collar and
a bonnet with an aigrette in it. She looked so
young and handsome that, together with the sale
of her piece of land, she wholly dazzled the sergeant,
who speculated on his chances of leading
her to the altar sometime within a year.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Duval treated herself to a new black
gown and a very forbidding-looking black bonnet,
but really presented an elegant though austere appearance.
Denise&rsquo;s white wedding gown was made
with her own fingers, and, although it was only a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>simple muslin, never was there a daintier looking
bride in the world than the sergeant&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>In the first row of seats in the church sat Paul
and Lucie, the latter charmingly dressed in honor
of the occasion. The chapel was filled with humbler
people, friends of the bride and bridegroom.
The bride, with her father, the sergeant, arrived in
great state in Lucie&rsquo;s victoria and pair and the
same equipage&mdash;the handsomest in Beaupr&eacute;&mdash;carried
the newly-married pair back to the large room
in one of the plain but comfortable hotels of the
place, where a wedding breakfast was served.</p>

<p>Toni was not at all frightened at the imminent
circumstances of the day. On the contrary, he felt
a sense of protection in marrying Denise. She
would always be at hand to take care of him, for
Toni felt the need of being taken care of just as
much, in spite of his five feet ten, and his one hundred
and fifty pounds weight, and his being the
crack rider in the regiment, as he had done in the
old days at Bienville when he ran away from the
little Clery boys. He did not, therefore, experience
the usual panic which often attacks the stoutest-hearted
bridegroom, and went through the wedding breakfast
with actual courage. He absolutely for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>got
everything painful in his past life. Nicolas and
Pierre melted away&mdash;he did not feel as if they had
ever existed. The secret which had haunted him was
a mere fantasy, that vanished in the glow of his
wedding morning.</p>

<p>Paul and Lucie came in during the breakfast
and Paul proposed the bridegroom&rsquo;s health with
his hand on Toni&rsquo;s shoulder, Toni grinning in
ecstasy meanwhile. Paul spoke of their early intimacy,
and Toni made a very appropriate reply&mdash;at
least Denise and Madame Marcel thought so.
After the lieutenant and his wife had left, the fun
grew fast and furious. It was as merry a wedding
breakfast as Paul&rsquo;s and Lucie&rsquo;s, even though the
guests were such simple people as would come to
the corporal&rsquo;s wedding with the sergeant&rsquo;s daughter.
Toni could have said with truth that it was
the happiest day of his life.</p>

<p>When the wedding party dispersed, and they returned
to the Duvals&rsquo; lodgings that the bride might
change her dress, the sergeant, being left alone in
the little sitting-room with Madame Marcel, grew
positively tender, saying to her in the manner
which he had found perfectly killing with the girls
twenty-five years before:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Madame, that we have seen our children
happily married we should think somewhat of our
own future. The same joy which those two children
have may be ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Marcel, who had heretofore received all
the sergeant&rsquo;s gallant speeches with an air of
blushing consciousness, suddenly burst out laughing
in a very self-possessed manner, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are much too old, Monsieur; we should
be quite ridiculous if either one of us thought of
marrying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sergeant received a shock at this, particularly
as he considered himself still young and
handsome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Madame Marcel,&rdquo; he replied impressively,
&ldquo;certainly age has not touched you and I
flatter myself&rdquo;&mdash;here he drew himself up and
twirled the ends of his superbly-waxed mustaches&mdash;&ldquo;that
so far time has not laid his hand heavily on
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you wish to marry, Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Madame
Marcel, still laughing, &ldquo;you ought to marry
some young girl. Men of your age always like
girls young enough to be their daughters,&rdquo; and she
laughed again quite impertinently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>The sergeant frowned at Madame Marcel. He
had never seen this phase of her character before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I assure you, Madame,&rdquo; he said stiffly, &ldquo;that if
I care to aspire to the hand of a young woman of
my daughter&rsquo;s age, I might not be really considered
too old; but I prefer a maturer person like yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Madame Marcel, seeing that the sergeant was
becoming deeply chagrined, determined not to dash
his hopes too suddenly, so she reassumed her old
manner of girlish embarrassment and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Monsieur, one wedding makes many, you
know; but a wedding is a fatiguing business to go
through with, particularly at our age. It will take
us both, at our time of life, several weeks to recover
from this delightful event and we may then discuss
the project you mention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was slightly encouraging, and as the sergeant
had nothing better to comfort himself with
he contrived to extract some satisfaction from it.</p>

<p>When Denise appeared, dressed in her neat gray
traveling gown, the Verneys&rsquo; handsome victoria
was at the door to take her and Toni to the station.
Toni and Denise felt very grand, as well as very
happy, sitting up in the fine victoria with the pair
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>of prancing bays, and although they were conscious
that the footman and coachman were thrusting
their tongues into their cheeks, it mattered very
little to Denise and Toni, whose black eyes were
lustrous with delight. At last, he reflected joyously,
he had some one who would be obliged to look
after him the rest of his life.</p>

<p>When they reached the station the train was almost
ready to depart. Toni had wished, on this
auspicious day, to travel to Paris second-class, but
the prudent Denise concluded that as they would go
through life third-class they had better begin on
that basis. So Toni selected a third-class carriage
which was vacant and, tipping half a franc to the
guard, he and Denise found themselves in it without
other company. It was their first moment alone
since they had been made one. Toni put his arm
around Denise and drew her head on his shoulder
with the strangest feeling in his heart of being protected,
and Denise, for her part, had the sense of
having adopted this fine, handsome, laughing fellow,
to shield under her wing the rest of her life.
Yet they were lovers deep and sincere. No French
gentleman had ever treated his fianc&eacute;e with greater
respect than Toni, the corporal, had treated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>Denise, or ever had a higher rapture in their first
long kiss.</p>

<p>He was roused from his dream in Paradise by the
consciousness of a sinister presence near him, and
his eyes fell on the red head of Nicolas peering like
the serpent in the Garden of Eden in at the window
of the railway carriage. If the place of eternal torment
had yawned before Toni&rsquo;s eyes he could not
have felt a greater horror. And this was increased
when Nicolas coolly opened the door of the carriage
and got in, followed by Pierre, and the two
seated themselves directly opposite the newly-married
pair. Almost immediately the train moved
off. Toni had only one thought in his mind&mdash;to
keep Denise from finding out that terrible secret of
his&mdash;why he hated and feared these men. He hated
and feared them now more than ever, but some
new courage seemed to be born in him. The cardinal
difference between a brave man and a coward
is that a brave man can think when he is afraid
and can even act sensibly, and a coward can not do
either. Always before this when he had been
frightened, Toni had acted like a fool, but now he
acted as sensibly as Paul Verney himself could, and
for once behaved bravely, although he was contend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>ing
with men instead of horses. The two rogues
opposite him leered at Denise, nudged each other,
and Pierre held out his hand to Toni.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo15"><img src="images/i_306.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;Seated themselves directly opposite the newly married pair.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Seated themselves directly opposite the newly married pair.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">&ldquo;How do you do, comrade?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>For answer, Toni folded his arms and looked at
the extended paw with disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you,&rdquo; he replied, in a voice as
steady as if he were managing a vicious brute of a
horse. &ldquo;Denise, don&rsquo;t look at them, my dear,&rdquo; and
he motioned her to sit with him in the furthest corner
of the carriage.</p>

<p>Denise surmised who these two individuals were,
but said nothing, only averting her eyes from them.
Nicolas then persisted in trying to converse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are back from Algiers,&rdquo; he remarked impressively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t require a genius to know that,&rdquo; Toni
answered tartly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great pity you were not
kept there for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He felt astonished at his own boldness in saying
this, and the devil of fear, taking on a new guise,
made him afraid of his own boldness. But, at all
events, he felt that there was no danger of his betraying
himself then before Denise. Nicolas and
Pierre continued to wink and make remarks, evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>dently
directed at Denise. Toni stood it quietly,
but the first time the guard passed he spoke to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These two fellows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are impertinent to
my wife. At the first station I would thank you to
put them in another carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The guard had seen the fine style in which Toni
had driven to the station with his bride, and also
respected Toni&rsquo;s smart corporal&rsquo;s uniform, so he
bowed politely and said, &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; and the next
station being reached in two minutes, Toni had the
satisfaction of seeing his two friends unceremoniously
hauled out and thrust into another carriage
which was before nearly full. As they went out
Pierre laughed&mdash;a laugh terrible in Toni&rsquo;s ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been very polite to us,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but we shall meet again. Remember I promised
you that when we parted two years ago, and we
never go back on what we say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This troubled Denise and when they were alone
Toni told her as much as he thought well for her
to know of Nicolas and Pierre, but it was not
enough to disturb her very much on her wedding
journey. Toni, however, again felt that old fear
clutching and tearing him. His courage had been
merely outward, and outward it continued. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>apparently the most smiling and cheerful bridegroom
in the whole city of Paris, but no man ever
carried on his heart a heavier load of anxiety and
oppression.</p>

<p>Madame Marcel had given Toni a little sum of
money which was quite beyond his corporal&rsquo;s pay
for his wedding tour, and they had taken a little
lodging in the humbler quarters of Paris, and here
they were to spend the precious week of their
honeymoon. It was still bright daylight at seven
on a June evening when they reached their lodgings
and removed the stains of travel. Toni, in the
gayest manner possible, proposed that they should
take a stroll on the river bank before going to their
supper. It was a heavenly evening and a gorgeous
sunset was mirrored in the dancing river as Toni
and Denise leaned over the parapet of the bridge
of the Invalides, holding each other&rsquo;s hands as
they had done when they were little children sitting
on the bench under the acacia tree at Bienville.
Toni could have groaned aloud in his agony.
He would be the happiest creature on earth if only
those two wretches had not appeared. He was
happy in spite of them, but then the terrible
thought came to him that they had promised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>kill him and Paul Verney, too, and they were of a
class of men who usually keep their word when they
promise villainy. He felt an acute pang of sorrow
for Denise and an acute pang for himself and
for Paul and Lucie&mdash;so young they all were, so
happy, and that happiness threatened by a couple
of wretches who would think no more of taking a
man&rsquo;s life than of killing a rat, if they had the
opportunity.</p>

<p>He looked at the crowds of gaily-dressed people
which filled the streets with life. He looked at
Denise in the charming freshness of her youth, her
tender eyes repeating with every glance that she
loved Toni better than anybody else in the world.
He considered all the splendor and beauty around
him&mdash;the dancing river and the great arched, dark
blue sky above them in which the palpitating stars
were shining faintly and a silver moon trembled&mdash;and
he could scarcely keep from groaning aloud
at the thought of being torn from all he loved. But
he gave no outward sign of it. Denise thought him
as happy as she was.</p>

<p>After their supper at a gay caf&eacute; they came
across one of those open-air balls which are a feature
of Paris, and they danced together merrily for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>an hour. Everybody saw they were sweethearts and
some jokes were made at their expense, which Toni
did not mind in the least and would have enjoyed
hugely, but&mdash;but&mdash; Afterward they walked home
under the quiet night sky. In place of their gaiety
and laughter a deep and solemn happiness possessed
Toni as well as Denise, except for this terrible
fear, black and threatening, which would not be
thrust out of his happiest hours.</p>

<p>Paris in June for a pair of lovers on a honeymoon
trip, with enough money to meet their modest
wants, is an earthly Paradise. Denise loved to exhibit
her muslin gowns, made with her own hands,
by the side of her handsome corporal, in the cheap
caf&eacute;s and theaters which they patronized. They
found acquaintances, as everybody does in Paris.
The lodging-house keeper became their friend and
invited them to her daughter&rsquo;s birthday fête. They
went out to Versailles on Sunday and saw the
fountains plashing, studied the windows of the
magnificent shops in the grand avenues, and were
perfectly happy, except for the black care that sat
upon Toni&rsquo;s heart. Life could be so delightful,
thought Toni, but his would end so soon. Toni almost
felt the knife that Nicolas would stick into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>him. He pondered over the various ways in which
he might be killed&mdash;a blow like that which felled
Count Delorme might do for him. He imagined
himself found dead in the streets of Beaupr&eacute; some
dark night, and the story of how he came by his
death would never be known. And he thought of
Paul&mdash;that his body might be found in a thicket
of the park of the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard, just as Count
Delorme&rsquo;s had been. Toni was an imaginative person
and the horror of his situation was enhanced by
the Paradise of the present. He wondered sometimes
how he managed to keep it all from Denise,
but he did for once.</p>

<p>Too soon the time came when he had to return to
Beaupr&eacute;. It was on a wet and gloomy day that he
and Denise alighted from a third-class carriage at
the little station. They walked straight to their
modest lodgings, and then Toni went to seek Paul.
His leave was not up by several hours, so he need
not report at once. He found Paul at the headquarters
building in a little room where he worked
alone. When Toni came in and shut the door carefully
behind him, Paul whirled around in his chair
expecting to see a radiant, rapturous Toni. Instead
of that, Toni dropped the mask which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>worn before Denise and looked at Paul with a pair
of eyes so distressed, so haunted, so anxious, that
Paul knew in a moment something had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Toni,&rdquo; he began, and then asked, &ldquo;What
is the matter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Toni, instead of standing at attention, leaned
heavily against the desk&mdash;his legs could hardly
support him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day I was married,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when Denise
and I got in the railway carriage to go to Paris,
Nicolas and Pierre got in, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul&rsquo;s ruddy, frank and smiling face grew pale
as Toni said these words. They might mean for
him, as well as for Toni, a decree of doom, and, like
Toni, he was so happy that the thought he should
be torn away from it all seemed the more cruel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what did they say and do?&rdquo; he inquired
after a painful pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were very insulting at first to Denise, but
I told her not to notice them, and they wanted to
shake hands with me, but I refused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; cried Paul, in amazement. &ldquo;Is it
possible that you didn&rsquo;t act like a poltroon and
shake hands with them and do whatever they asked
you to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>This was no sarcasm on Paul&rsquo;s part, but a plain
expression of what he expected Toni would do, and
Toni was not at all offended at this imputation on
his courage and good sense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I acted the man with them. I
never did it before, but I did more than that&mdash;I
called the guard, who made them go into another
carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Paul gazed at Toni with wide-eyed surprise.
Here was the most astonishing thing that ever happened&mdash;Toni
actually showing a little courage with
these men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can hardly believe it is you, Toni, standing
before me. If you had shown the same spirit all the
time, you would not now live in dread about that
Delorme affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; sighed poor Toni, &ldquo;but you
know how I always was, Paul.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you are going to be something different
now,&rdquo; replied Paul cheerfully. It was not
pleasant&mdash;the thought that these two rascals, who
had promised to kill him as well as Toni, were alive
and in Paris, but Paul&rsquo;s nerves were perfect and he
easily recovered his balance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the thought of it&mdash;the thought of it!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>cried Toni, opening his arms and standing up
straight. &ldquo;The knife entering my breast or that
blow on the side of the head such as they gave
Count Delorme. I feel them and see them everywhere
I look. If I see a man walking on the street
he seems to take the shape of Nicolas or Pierre.
Every time I turn a corner I expect to see them.
And there is Denise&mdash;and then I think of you
being found some night or some day, dead&mdash;will
it be in the morning or in the evening&mdash;will it be
in the summer time or in the autumn?&mdash;and Madame
and the little one&mdash;&rdquo; Falling into a chair,
Toni broke down and cried and sobbed bitterly.
Paul put his arm around Toni&rsquo;s neck. Their two
heads were close together just as they had been in
the old days on the bridge at Bienville. He said
no word to Toni, but the touch of his arm was
strength and comfort, and presently Toni stopped
crying and grew calm again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Toni,&rdquo; said Paul, &ldquo;I think we can
take care of ourselves. We must go armed. It
would not do any good if you were to inform on
those two rascals. Of course they would deny it&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t punish a man for crime he hasn&rsquo;t committed.
We shall have to take our chances&mdash;that is all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>But if one of us is killed, the other one will be safe,
because then your story will be believed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was not much comfort to Toni, who replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are killed, what will life be to me? and if
I am killed think of Denise, and you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They sat a little while longer talking, Paul encouraging
Toni and at last raising in him some of
the spirit which had made him have Nicolas and
Pierre turned out of the railway carriage. Paul
said that they were comparatively safe at Beaupr&eacute;
where Nicolas and Pierre would not dare to come,
but Toni did not take this view. He thought that
men who had committed one murder and had contemplated
another for two years would not hesitate
to come to Beaupr&eacute; in order to fulfil their purpose.
The effort to keep his agony from being
suspected by Denise was, however, perfectly successful.
Denise suspected nothing, nor did the sergeant
nor anybody, except Paul Verney.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2></div>

<p>Baby Paul&rsquo;s birthday was celebrated a few days
after Toni and Denise returned, and there was
a little fête, to which they were invited. It was
given on the terrace of the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard where
Paul and Lucie&rsquo;s wedding breakfast had been
served. The baby, a beautiful child toddling
about, clung to Jacques, which hung around his
neck by a little gold chain, with as much tenacity as
Toni had clasped that gallant soldier for so many
years of his boyhood. Also the little boy clung to
Toni and, refusing to go to his nurse, insisted on
being carried in Toni&rsquo;s arms the whole afternoon.
This pleased Toni immensely and amused everybody
present. Lucie looked charming as ever, and
thanked Toni for playing nurse-maid. The child&rsquo;s
beauty, and the delight of the young father and
mother in him, almost broke Toni&rsquo;s heart. In a
little while the boy might be fatherless, and that
gay and graceful Lucie might be widowed. He was
still haunted by that vision of the face of Nicolas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>whom he reckoned, if there be such a thing as a
gradation in villainy, to be a worse villain than
Pierre; that is to say, a more dangerous one. He
glanced around him fearfully, expecting to see one
or the other of them. At last, while walking about
the grounds below the terrace, still carrying the little
Paul in his short fluffy white dress, there was
something like a horrible passing vision of Nicolas&rsquo;
red head behind the hedge that divided the gardens
from the park.</p>

<p>At that moment Lucie, followed by the nurse,
appeared, tripping through the grass. Her pretty
black head was bare and she held up her dainty
chiffon skirts, showing beautiful black satin shoes
with shining buckles on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to look for you, Toni,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you
must enjoy yourself this afternoon and not be troubled
with little Paul all the time. He must be made
to go to his nurse and behave himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no trouble, Madame,&rdquo; said Toni from the
very bottom of his heart; &ldquo;I love to have the little
fellow in my arms and he is so quiet and good when
he is with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, dearest,&rdquo; said Lucie to the baby, &ldquo;nurse
will take you&rdquo;&mdash;at which little Paul was neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>good nor quiet, but kicked and screamed and would
have nothing to say to the nurse, much to the indignation
of the latter, who accused Toni of spoiling
the child outrageously.</p>

<p>Glancing around at that moment, Toni distinctly
saw Nicolas&rsquo; head behind the hedge. Not only
he saw it, but Lucie as well. She walked toward
the opening through which the path ran, and, as
she saw Nicolas, very dusty and travel-stained, her
generous heart went out in pity to him. She was
always taking in stray cats and dogs, and stray
human beings as well, and giving them a dinner and
a franc, and on this day above all others no one
near her should want for anything. She went up
to Nicolas and asked pleasantly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom are you looking for, my man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nicolas, in no wise taken aback, replied politely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For an old comrade of mine&mdash;Toni by name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not recognize Lucie, but seeing something
in her manner of address which indicated that he
might get money out of her, he whined:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been serving my time in Africa and got
back to France very poor, and I have hardly had
a good meal since I came.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not say that,&rdquo; cried Lucie. &ldquo;No per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>son,
and certainly no one who has been a soldier,
shall want for a meal where we are. Come.&rdquo; She
turned and walked toward the ch&acirc;teau, the nurse,
meanwhile, wrestling vigorously with the baby,
whom Toni secretly encouraged in his rebellion.</p>

<p>Nicolas followed Lucie and was delighted at his
own diplomacy. He reckoned her good for a couple
of francs at least. She showed him a side entrance
where, in a small and shady courtyard, the
servants were drinking little Paul&rsquo;s health and cutting
a birthday cake expressly designed for them.
Nicolas went in and not only ate and drank in
honor of the little child whose father he meant to
murder, but was provided with a good meal by
Lucie&rsquo;s orders. After he had eaten and drunk, he
desired to slink away, not thinking it worth while
to risk meeting Paul even in the pursuit of the couple
of francs which he felt sure he could get out of
Lucie. As he slouched rapidly across the lawn, he
looked up and saw, on the terrace, Paul and Lucie
standing together. All the guests had left and
Madame Bernard had gone indoors, but Toni,
meaning to give Paul a word of warning, remained
a little while with Denise waiting for his chance to
speak. But his warning was not necessary. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>Lucie saw Nicolas&rsquo; shabby figure slinking across
the lawn, she said to Paul:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a man that I found outside the hedge
and he has been a soldier, so I made him come in
and he drank the baby&rsquo;s health with the servants,
and I made them give him a good meal besides.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A glance of recognition, which neither Lucie nor
Denise saw, passed between Paul and Toni. Paul
only remarked to her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be a little careful, Lucie, in introducing
strange men among the servants, even
though they claim to be soldiers. However, no
harm is done this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he said he was hungry, Paul, and I can not
bear that any one at the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard or at our
house should want, for anything on this delightful
day&mdash;the baby&rsquo;s first birthday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Lucie spoke, her eyes sparkled and she laid
her hand on Paul&rsquo;s shoulder. Their honeymoon
had, as yet, no break.</p>

<p>Toni then turned to go with Denise.</p>

<p>He maintained his outward calm, though inwardly
he was storm-tossed. He knew that Paul Verney
suffered none of these qualms of terror, but was
perfectly cool, calm and self-possessed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a thing is courage,&rdquo; thought Toni,
&ldquo;to be a brave man all around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But he was learning to master his fear a little,
or at least to control the outward expression
of it. He and Denise walked briskly through the
park. Denise, it being still their honeymoon, would
have liked to loiter a little in the twilight shadows,
but Toni making the excuse that he would soon be
due at the barracks, they lost no time. He took
Denise&rsquo;s hand in his. She thought it was a lover&rsquo;s
clasp, but in truth he felt that old clinging to
Denise for protection as well as affection. He
wished that he could have put his hand in his pocket
and felt Jacques, but Jacques was now the treasured
possession of the little Paul. Toni was glad
when he got out of the park and into the lighted
streets.</p>

<p>He had to go to the barracks and Denise was to
return to their lodgings. They parted under a dark
archway and had the opportunity to exchange a
farewell kiss. Toni wondered if it would be the
last kiss he would ever give Denise. For the first
time, Denise, looking into Toni&rsquo;s troubled eyes,
began to suspect something was wrong with him,
but she said no word and went quietly home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>It was then nearly eight o&rsquo;clock and Toni was
kept busy at the barracks for an hour more. He
was off duty that night and was allowed to spend
it at home, and at ten o&rsquo;clock he left the big barrack
yard to go to his lodgings. The afternoon
and early evening had been brilliantly lovely, but
now a cold rain was fitfully falling and the night
sky was dark with storm-clouds which raced across
the face of the moon. The streets of the little town
grew deserted, and Toni, as he walked rapidly
along, saw Nicolas and Pierre, in imagination, behind
every wall and tree and corner. There was a
short way to his lodgings, which led through the
narrow and dark streets, but the long way led by
the railway station where there were always people
moving about and a plenty of light, and Toni concluded
to take the long way home. He ran nearly
all the way, longing to get to the circle of light
made by the railway station. There was one place
where he had to cross a bridge which spanned the
iron tracks, and it was quite dark. Toni felt his
heart thumping and jumping as he neared this
place. Once across it, he would feel comparatively
safe, and would walk along quietly in the glare of
the electric lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>As he got to this place he heard a smothered cry,
and, frightened as he was, he stopped and peered
over the rail of the bridge. Near the track two figures
were wrestling desperately. In the half-darkness,
Toni could see that each one was trying to
throw the other on the railway track. Far-off
sounded the roar and reverberation, the thunder
and shaking of the earth, of the fast-approaching
express train. Toni was thrilled with horror and
frozen to the ground. He could not have moved to
have saved his life. In fact, there was no way for
him to reach the two men struggling to destroy
each other, except by leaping over the bridge twenty
feet below. The huge headlight of the onrushing
train cast a ghastly glare over the black earth,
intersected by lines of steel, and revealed to Toni
that the two figures in mortal struggle were Nicolas
and Pierre. Nicolas was the stronger of the
two, and he was trying to throw Pierre under the
wheels of the advancing locomotive, but Pierre
hung on with unnatural strength. He could not
drag himself away from the track, but he clung
fiercely and desperately to Nicolas. In an instant
more the train thundered upon the two men and
wild shrieks cut the air above the roar. The locomo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>tive
gave a sudden jar, and then plunged ahead
and came to a stop. Toni, holding on with both
hands to the parapet of the bridge, could have cried
aloud in fear and horror of what was passing before
him. A dozen figures of men with flashing lanterns
appeared at once, and by the side of the track they
picked up Pierre and Nicolas where they had been
pitched. Both of them were quite dead.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<a id="illo16"><img src="images/i_324.jpg" width="450" alt="&ldquo;He stopped and peered over the rail of the bridge.&rdquo;" title=""  /></a></div>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;He stopped and peered over the rail of the bridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="smgap">All of Toni&rsquo;s faculties had seemed numbed while
he had watched this tragedy of less than five minutes&rsquo;
duration, but in the space of a second the instinct
of flight developed in him, and he turned
around and ran, retracing his path, as if a thousand
devils were after him. His heart was thumping
still more wildly than when he had followed the
same road a little while before, but now it was for
joy. Toni was a primitive creature and was not
troubled by any scruples in rejoicing at the death
of his fellow man, when that fellow man had worried
and troubled him as Pierre and Nicolas had
done. He kept on thanking God in his heart, and
even whispering his thanks as he ran.</p>

<p>He took the short way back to his lodgings. In
the same street, only a few doors off, was a small
church. The lights in most of the houses were out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>All was quiet&mdash;the church and houses, as well as
the people, seemed asleep. Toni&rsquo;s pious instincts
rose up and possessed him. He must go into that
church and thank God for himself, for Denise, for
Paul and for Lucie. He crept up the steps and
quietly tried the door, but it was locked. Toni had
a jack-knife in his pocket, and the lock on the
church door not being worth much, he deliberately
pried it open, and stepped softly into the church.
It was dark and damp, and the flagstones were very
cold, but far-off before the little altar the sanctuary
lamp glowed brightly. A sudden remembrance
overcame Toni of Madame Ravenel not daring to
go far in the church, and he honestly reckoned
himself a much worse person than Madame Ravenel,
so he fell down on the cold stones of the aisle,
just within the door, not on his knees, but on his
face, and thanked God and all the saints that Pierre
and Nicolas were dead. He recalled with an agony
of remorse that when he was a boy he used to run
away on Sundays instead of going to church, and
felt himself the chief of sinners because he had not
listened with the strictest attention and the deepest
satisfaction to long-winded sermons. He began to
sob and pray aloud in his ecstasy of gratitude, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>promised more things to the Most High than the
greatest saint that ever lived could have performed.
He repeated every prayer he knew, but as his repertory
was not extensive, he had to say them over
again many times. The stones were hard and
cold as most stones are, but Toni thought them a
bed of roses. He did not know how long he had
lain there, but presently sheer fatigue brought him
to his senses. It occurred to him that Denise might
be anxious about him, but he was in that exaltation
of piety which made him rather exult in being uncomfortable
himself and making Denise uncomfortable,
too&mdash;a not uncommon condition in natures like
Toni&rsquo;s. He had been there more than an hour when
he heard a light step behind him and turned. There
was Denise with her hat and jacket on. She tiptoed
up to him and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I went out in the street to look for you, Toni,
and I saw the church door open and you lying here.
What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanking God!&rdquo; responded Toni out loud.
&ldquo;Down on your knees, Denise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Denise, very much astounded at this newly-developed
piety of Toni&rsquo;s, did as she was bid, having
been piously brought up. At the end of a few min<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>utes
she rose, but Toni was obstinate. He wanted
to stay in the church all night on his knees. Denise,
determined to find out what ailed him, spoke
to him with that tone of gentle authority which he
had never resisted since they were little children together,
walking hand in hand at Bienville. She
dragged Toni out of the church, stumbling along
in the darkness, and he shut the door carefully.
They were only a step or two from their lodgings,
and climbing up to their two little rooms, Toni
took Denise in his arms and poured out the whole
story of Nicolas and Pierre, sobbing between times,
and laughing, like one possessed. Denise wept&mdash;she
saw nothing to laugh at&mdash;and actually expressed
some pity for the two lost souls of Nicolas and
Pierre. This seemed really impious to Toni.</p>

<p>The recital did not take long, and then Toni,
taking his cap, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must run now, as fast as I can, to the Ch&acirc;teau
Bernard. Monsieur Paul must know this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Denise did not detain him and he ran softly
down stairs and took his way through the dark
streets and along the deserted highway until he
reached the park of the Ch&acirc;teau Bernard. He
climbed the wall and walked swiftly through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>park until he got to the ch&acirc;teau, standing white
and stately upon its broad terraces. It was then
quite one o&rsquo;clock in the morning. The sky had
cleared and a great hobgoblin moon was looking
down on the church steeples of the town, visible
afar off. Toni knew the window of Paul&rsquo;s room.
It was on the first floor above the ground floor, and
at a corner. He knew the only way to awaken
Paul, without alarming the house, was to throw
pebbles at his window, but there were no pebbles to
be found. He remembered, however, that Paul was
a light sleeper, and going under the window Toni
called out softly a dozen times&mdash;&ldquo;Paul&mdash;Paul&mdash;Monsieur.&rdquo;
Presently the window of the room came
open, and he heard Paul&rsquo;s voice asking softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; whispered Toni, creeping under the
window. &ldquo;Come down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a few moments a small door under the window
opened noiselessly, and Paul came out in his
trousers and shirt. Toni caught him around the
neck and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are dead, Paul, both of them. They were
fighting on the railway track when the Paris train
came along. I saw them both quite dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>Paul knew at once whom Toni meant. A great
wave of gratitude welled up in his heart. He did
not, like Toni, drop on his face and weep and fall
into a paroxysm of piety, but he felt his release
from the sentence of death pronounced against
them both, as much as Toni did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we are saved, Toni, from that knife-thrust
in the heart or that blow on the side of the head,&rdquo;
said Paul quietly. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told Denise,&rdquo; whispered Toni, &ldquo;now you
go, Paul, and tell Madame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then a light shone in Lucie&rsquo;s window. She
passed into Paul&rsquo;s room, and going to the open
window, her white figure leaned out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am coming in now, dearest,&rdquo; called Paul softly,
stepping under the window. &ldquo;I have good
news.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a little while Toni was plodding back through
the park. He meant to be a model husband, the
best father that ever lived, if God should give him
children, the most worthy, blameless corporal in
the French army. He meant to give all his substance
to the poor, including Denise&rsquo;s dowry, to
go to church twice a day on week-days and three
times on Sundays, and to lead a life which would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>be a perfect combination of the contemplative and
the actively charitable. All of the time that he
could spare from his military duties, he meant to
give to prayer, and to make Denise pray with him.
He intended to fast and to make Denise fast, too.
Not St. Elizabeth, queen of Hungary, married to
St. Louis, king of France, could have led the life
which Toni, in these first moments, promised that
he and Denise should lead. Never was there on
earth so good a man as Toni meant to be thereafter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Guarded Flame&rsquo;, by W. B. Maxwell, is a book
to challenge the attention of the reading public as a remarkable
study of moral law and its infraction. Mr. Maxwell
is the son of Miss M. E. Braddon (Mrs. John Maxwell),
whose novels were famous a generation ago, and his first
book &lsquo;Vivien&rsquo; made the English critics herald him as a
new force in the world of letters. &lsquo;The Guarded Flame&rsquo;
is an even more astonishing production, a big book that
takes rank with the most important fiction of the year.
It is not a book for those who read to be amused or to be
entertained. It touches the deepest issues of life and death.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Albany
Argus.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;The most powerfully written book of the year.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The

Such a one has come unheralded; but from a source whence

Ch&acirc;teau of Montplaisir,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sprightly Romance
of Marsac,&rdquo; etc. Illustrated. Cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With so delicate a touch and appreciation of the detail
of domestic and plantation life, with so wise comprehension
of the exalted and sometimes stilted notions of Southern
honor and with humorous depiction of African fidelity and
bombast to interest and amuse him, it only gradually dawns
on a reader that &lsquo;The Victory&rsquo; is the truest and most
tragic presentation yet before us of the rending of home
ties, the awful passions, the wounded affections personal
and national, and the overwhelming questions of honor
which weighed down a people in the war of son against
father and brother against brother.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Among the many romances written recently about the
Civil War, this one by Miss Seawell takes a high place....
Altogether, &lsquo;The Victory,&rsquo; a title significant in several
ways, makes a strong appeal to the lover of a good tale.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Outlook.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Seawell&rsquo;s narrative is not only infused with a
tender and sympathetic spirit of romance and surcharged
with human interests, but discloses, in addition, careful and
minute study of local conditions and characteristic mannerisms.
It is an intimate study of life on a Virginia
plantation during an emergent and critical period of American
history.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Philadelphia North American.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is one of the romances that make, by spirit as well as
letter, for youth and high feeling. It embodies, perhaps, the
best work this author yet has done.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chicago Record-Herald.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Aside from the engaging story itself and the excellent
manner in which it is told there is much of historic interest
in this vivid word-picture of the customs and manners of a
period which has formed the background of much fiction.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Brooklyn

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
